    kdv_decompressor(kdu_codestream codestream, int precision, bool is_signed,
                     kdu_thread_env *env=NULL, int double_buffering_height=0);
      /* The decompressor object's structure and parameters are derived from
         the supplied `codestream' object; however, the sample precision and
         signed/unsigned properties of the data to be written to the VIX file
         are supplied separately, so as to ensure that they will be consistent
         with the VIX file header which has already been written.
            If non-NULL, the `env' argument specifies a multi-threading
         environment to be used for multi-threaded processing, in place of
         the default single-processing implementation.  This is useful for
         accelerating the throughput on machines with multiple physical
         processors.
            The `double_buffering_height' argument is useful only for
         multi-threaded environments.  If non-zero, this argument is passed
         to `kdu_multi_synthesis::create' as the `processing_stripe_height'
         value, with `double_buffering' set to true.  In this case, DWT
         processing for individual tile-components can proceed in separate
         threads, which provides additional opportunities for parallelism
         over and above those afforded by processing code-blocks in different
         threads.  The option is most likely of interest only for systems
         with a significant number of physical processors (e.g., 4). */

      /* Decompresses the supplied codestream (must already have been created
         with a valid compressed data source as input), into an internally
         allocated buffer.
            The `next_codestream' argument is of interest only
         in multi-threading environments.  In particular, it provides a means
         to keep processing resources active even when we come to the end of
         processing a current codestream (even while we are storing
         decompressed results via the `store_frame' function).  In the current
         implementation, the initial block decoding jobs for the
         `next_codestream' are automatically activated when processing of the
         current `codestream' leaves the system under-utilized, in the sense
         defined by `kdu_thread_entity::add_queues'.  A more general
         implementation might allow for the complete background processing of
         a next codestream while data is being stored.  However, this would
         require the provision of an additional frame buffer to avoid
         overwriting the data being stored with newly decompressed data for
         the next frame.
            As with `codestream', any valid `next_codestream' must be supplied
         in a created state, with a valid compressed data source as input.
         Moreover, an error will be generated if the next call to
         `process_frame' uses a codestream other than the `next_codestream'
         supplied here. */

     into the frame buffer.  The `next_tile' pointer refers to either the next
     tile in the current frame, or the first tile in the next codestream; its
     `engine' has been started, which means that there are code-block decoding
     tasks which can be performed in the background by Kakadu's thread
     scheduler.  However, these jobs will not be performed until the system
     becomes under-utilized, in the sense described by the
     `kdu_thread_entity::add_queue' function.  This is managed through a
     `env_batch_idx' counter, which increments each time a new tile queue is
     created. */
