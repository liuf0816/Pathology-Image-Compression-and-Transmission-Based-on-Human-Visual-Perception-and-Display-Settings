         requirement is that the `codestream' objects passed into the
         `process_frame' function all have the same structure.
            If non-NULL, the `env' argument specifies a multi-threading
         environment to be used for multi-threaded processing, in place of
         the default single-processing implementation.  This is useful for

      /* Processes the video data currently loaded into the buffer,
         compressing it into a new field within the supplied `video' object.
         Upon entry, the `video' object must already have an open image
         (i.e., `video->open_image' must be called outside this function).
         Similarly, the caller is responsible for closing the open image
         once this function has returned.  The `codestream' object must
         already have been created for output by the caller; its `flush'
         function is called from within the present function, immediately
         before returning.
            Note that the size of the `layer_bytes' and `layer_thresholds'
         arrays must match the `num_layer_specs' argument supplied to the
         constructor.  The contents of these arrays are copied internally,
         but the original values are not modified by the present function.
            The function returns the distortion-length slope threshold
         selected by the rate control algorithm for the final quality layer.
         This value may be used to provide a bound for the generation of
         coding passes in the next video frame, thereby saving computation in
         the CPU-intensive block encoding phase.
            The `trim_to_rate' argument is passed through to
         `kdu_codestream::flush'.  If true, that function will perform more
         careful rate allocation, at the expense of some computation. */
