<A name="Introduction"></A>
<h1 class="section">Introduction</h1>
<p>
   This brief document is designed to accompany the two demonstration viewers
   which come with Kakadu, namely "kdu_show" and "kdu_macshow". The former is a
   JPEG2000 file viewer for Windows platforms, running anything from Windows 95
   on, while the second is for MAC platforms running anything from MAC-OSX 10.4
   on. All source code to each of these tools is provided with licensed copies of
   Kakadu and may be used to aid in the construction of more elaborate
   applications. However, both viewers already possess a very full list of
   features. Both viewers offer mostly the same functionality and mostly the same
   set of menu options and accelerator keys, differing primarily in their
   Graphical User Interface code, which is inherently operating-system dependent.
   They are both implemented on top of powerful platform-independent Kakadu
   API's, such as `<em>kdu_region_compositor</em>', `<em>jpx_source</em>',
   `<em>mj2_source</em>' and the like.
</p>
<p>
   We use the term "<em>kdu_macshow</em>" to distinguish the MAC version of the
   viewer in this documentation, and also in the naming conventions employed in
   the Kakadu source code. However, on a MAC system, "<em>kdu_macshow</em>" is
   also named "<em>kdu_show</em>". Unless clearly distinguished by the context,
   all statements in this document which concern "<em>kdu_show</em>" apply
   equally to "<em>kdu_macshow</em>".
</p>
<p>
   At the time of this writing, each viewer possesses some features that the
   other does not:
</p>
<ul>
   <li>
      <p>
         The main unique feature possessed by "<em>kdu_macshow</em>" is a dynamically
         generated catalog of metadata labels, along with their associations, which
         opens as an optional panel on the right-hand side of the image viewing window
         when browsing JP2/JPX files with metadata. This catalog is tightly linked into
         the metadata editor and the file structure browsing system (known as
         Metashow). Moreover, clicking on items in the catalog provides a very
         efficient means for navigating to associated codestreams, compositing layers,
         animation frames and regions of interest within these, depending on how the
         metadata is associated.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         A second unique feature of "<em>kdu_macshow</em>" is that the single
         application can open any number of image/video files in separate viewing
         windows. The application can arrange these views for you and synchronize video
         playback where appropriate. It also provides you with the option to broadcast
         menu commands to all windows, rather than just the one which has the focus.
         These features are offered via the menu item entitled "Windows". Specifically,
         the Command-A accelerator arranges all windows, the Command-B accelerator
         schedules the next menu command (via the menu or an accelerator key) to be
         broadcast to all windows, and the Command-Shift-B accelerator schedules all
         subsequent menu commands to be broadcast until the broadcast mode is cancelled
         via another invocation of the Command-Shift-B accelerator. These features
         allow you to zoom, rotate, advance image components or play video frames in a
         synchronized fashion from multiple image/video sources.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         The main unique feature possessed by the Windows-based "<em>kdu_show</em>"
         application is that it also supports remote image browsing as a JPIP client.
      </p>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>
   In future releases, both viewers should support all these features along with
   additional enhancements.
</p>

<A name="Basic Operations"></A>
<h1 class="section">Basic Operations</h1>
<h2 class="subsection">Opening and Closing Files</h2>
<p>
   The File menu may be used to open and close files. Alternatively, you may find
   the "o" accelerator key (Command-O on the MAC) useful for opening files
   quickly. Opening a new file automatically closes any existing open file. You
   can supply the name of a file to "<em>kdu_show</em>" on the command line, in
   which case that file will be opened on start up and its dimensions will guide
   the initial size of the view window.
</p>
<p>
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool can open JP2 files, JPX files, unwrapped JPEG2000
   codestreams and even Motion JPEG2000 (MJ2) video files.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Panning, Zoom and Re-orienting</h2>
<p>
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool started out as a sophisticated demonstration
   application to showcase some of Kakadu's capabilities for incremental
   decompression of large images, based on spatial regions of interest (view
   ports), as well as Kakadu's ability to decompress images in a geometrically
   transformed domain. In fact, Kakadu's codestream management architecture has
   always allowed compressed JPEG2000 images to be accessed as though they had
   been compressed as smaller image, rotated and/or cropped versions of
   themselves. As a result, the core "<em>kdu_show</em>" features have always
   been those of panning, zooming, rotating and flipping a viewport into the
   compressed image.
</p>
<p>
   Panning may be accomplished via the scroll-bars, or using the arrow keys. The
   PageUP and PageDown keys may also be used for panning (Windows only). The
   image may also be dragged around with the mouse while the left mouse button is
   depressed and the shift key held down.
</p>
<p>
   Zooming may be accomplished via the View menu, toolbar buttons, or with the
   "z" (zoom in) and "ctrl-z" (zoom out) accelerators. By default, zooming is
   centred about the middle of the current viewport, but you may define an
   alternate focus box using the method described below. Zooming out is
   accomplished using the multi-resolution attributes of the discrete wavelet
   transform (DWT). As such, the degree to which you can zoom out is limited by
   the number of DWT levels created when the image was compressed. Although this
   limit could readily be circumvented by rescaling the decompressed image, it
   provides useful feedback to content creators, making them aware of the
   limitations associated with using too few DWT levels.
</p>
<p>
   Rotation and flipping may be accomplished via the View menu, the toolbar
   button, or with the "[", "]", "_" and "\" accelerators. Note, however, that
   any rotation which involves image transposition (not just horizontal and
   vertical flipping) may slightly alter the displayed imagery if it happens to
   have been compressed using JPEG2000's reversible processing path (Kakadu's
   "Creversible=yes" attribute). The reason for this is that horizontal and
   vertical aspects of the wavelet transform do not completely commute when the
   reversible transform is used, due to LSB rounding effects. Kakadu accomplishes
   rotation by decompressing the imagery in a reverse order and performing the
   wavelet transform in an alternate order, rather than just decompressing the
   image and then subsequently reorienting it.
</p>
<p>
   The application automatically resizes its window to match the image size,
   unless the image is too large to be viewed in the current window, in which
   case a restricted viewport is displayed. You may adjust the window size via
   the usual resize handles. Alternatively, and often more conveniently, you may
   enlarge or shrink the view window quickly using the "w" and "s" accelerator
   keys.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special note on zooming: </strong>JPX files can contain compositions
   of codestream imagery, where each composed piece has arbitrary scale factors.
   The "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool handles such imagery correctly, regardless of the
   implied scaling factors, but there can be no one global scaling factor which
   results in optimal rendering of the entire composition. Also, the policy in
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" is to keep the global scaling factor constant as you
   navigate to different compositing layers and/or composited frames. As a
   result, you may find that the scaling factor applied to a particular
   codestream image component of interest is not ideal. Ideal scaling factors are
   integer expansion factors and power of 2 decimation factors. Whenever you use
   the "z" (zoom in) and "ctrl-z" (zoom out) function, the zoom factor is
   automatically adjusted to one which is ideal for the top-most or dominant
   imagery found within the view window or focus box (see below). However, you
   may also find the "alt-z" (optimize zoom) function very useful. It makes the
   smallest possible change to the current global scaling factor so as to
   optimally render the content which is dominant within the view window or the
   focus box (see below). Keep this function in mind when browsing complex JPX
   content.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Special note on zooming vs. display scaling:</strong> The
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" tool also provides you with a special "<em>Scale X2</em>"
   feature, which may be accessed via the View menu (Windows and MAC) or the
   toolbar button (Windows only). While this may seem very similar to zooming,
   there is an important distinction. The "<em>Scale X2</em>" features causes
   each rendered image pixel to be displayed using a 2x2 block of display pixels,
   regardless of the current zoom setting. For example, zooming out from the
   image (so that it is being rendered at 50% resolution) causes the highest
   frequency subbands and the last stage of DWT synthesis to be dropped from the
   compressed imagery. With the "<em>Scale X2</em>" you can visualize the
   resulting imagery more clearly, especially on displays with very small pixels.
   When zooming in beyond 100% resolution, the "<em>Scale X2</em>" essentially
   just gives you another factor of 2 in zoom, but it allows the operating system
   to use GPU resources to do the scaling, which can result in faster rendering
   of zoomed imagery to the display.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Focus Boxes</h2>
<p>
   Focus boxes have at least 3 uses in "<em>kdu_show</em>": 1) they define a
   centre for zooming; 2) they define the region of interest during remote image
   browsing with JPIP (see Section <span class="ref">sec<sub>j</sub>pip</span>);
   and 3) they define spatial regions to be associated with metadata added using
   the methods described in Section
   <span class="ref">sec<sub>m</sub>etadata</span>.
</p>
<p>
   To define a focus box, hold the left mouse button down while dragging the
   mouse to define the region of interest. If you change your mind after
   depressing the mouse button, you may hit the escape key to cancel the focus
   box being defined, without affecting any pre-existing focus box.
</p>
<p>
   To remove a focus box, you may: 1) use the Focus menu; or 2) hit the "f"
   accelerator key.
</p>
<p>
   By default, the focus box will be displayed using both a highlighting
   technique and a dashed outline. The highlighting technique makes the rest of
   the image slightly darker, and the focus box slightly lighter. You can turn
   off the highlighting by using the Focus menu, or hitting the ``h'' accelerator
   key.
</p>
<p>
   You can widen or shrink an existing focus box using the Focus menu, or the
   ``shift-w'' and ``shift-s'' accelerators.
</p>
<p>
   You can pan the focus box using the arrow keys, while holding down the shift
   key. Basically, the accelerators which affect the focus box are identical to
   those used to manipulate the view window, except that the shift key is held
   down.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Quality Layers</h2>
<p>
   JPEG2000 codestreams may contain multiple embedded image qualities, which form
   the foundation of quality progressive remote image browsing. By default, local
   files are opened at maximum quality, but it can be useful to see the visual
   quality associated with each compressed quality layer. To reduce the number of
   quality layers you may use the Quality menu or the "&lt;" accelerator. You may
   increase the quality again using the Quality menu using the "&gt;"
   accelerator. These manipulations automatically change the status bar to one
   which displays the number of quality layers which are in use.
</p>
<p>
   When playing video content, you may well find that displaying all of the
   available quality layers is too slow. Reducing the quality typically increases
   rendering speed dramatically, especially when the original content was
   losslessly compressed. Of course, this is only possible if multiple quality
   layers are available in the source content.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Navigating Between Image Elements</h2>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>n</sub>avigating"></a>
</p>
<p>
   The "kdu_show" tool has 3 fundamental modes of image display, as follows:
</p>
<dl class="description">
   <dt class="leadin">Single Component Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, only a single image component is displayed as a greyscale image.
         Image components typically correspond to colour channels (e.g., red, green,
         blue, or luminance, and chrominance channels), but they may correspond to
         alpha blending channels, palette indices, or anything else.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         To enter single component mode, use the View menu or hit either of the ``1''
         or ``+'' accelerator keys. While in this mode, you may navigate forward and
         backward within the image components of a given codestream by using the View
         menu or the ``+'' and ``-'' accelerators.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         While in single component mode, you may navigate amongst the codestreams in
         the file (JPX and MJ2 files may have any number of codestreams) using the
         RETURN and BACKSPACE keys. Alternatively, you may use the View menu.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Single Compositing Layer Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, only one compositing layer is displayed, usually as a colour
         image, or alpha blended against a solid white background. A JP2 file contains
         exactly one compositing layer, which is the rendered colour image. A JPX file
         may contain any number of compositing layers. A raw codestream is treated as
         having exactly one compositing layer, corresponding to our best guess
         regarding the intended display image.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         A Motion JPEG2000 (MJ2) file may contain one or more video tracks, each of
         which is treated as a compositing layer. This is sensible since MJ2 tracks can
         be composed onto a richer surface in the same way that JPX compositing layers
         can be composed. The fundamental difference between MJ2 video tracks as
         compositing layers and JPX compositing layers is that the former typically
         involves multiple images (video frames), all with the same dimensions, whereas
         the latter involves only a single image.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         To enter single compositing layer mode, use the View menu or hit the "L"
         accelerator key. While in this mode, you may navigate forward and backward
         amongst JPX compositing layers or amongst frames of a current MJ2 video track,
         by using the RETURN and BACKSPACE keys or the View menu. To move to a
         different MJ2 video track, use the View menu or the video playback dialog. The
         video playback dialog is available on Windows only; it may be activated from
         the View menu or via the toolbar, providing additional controls for navigating
         between frames, for real-time playback and status information. On the MAC
         viewer, video playback is controlled via the Play menu items, each of which
         have accelerators for convenience of use.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         You may also enter single compositing layer mode by holding both the "shift"
         and "control" keys down and left clicking the mouse (Windows only), while it
         is over any particular compositing layer. This method allows you to quickly
         navigate to a particular compositing layer within a complete composition.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Composited Image Mode:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         In this mode, the application displays what it believes to be the intended
         image. For JP2 files and unwrapped raw codestreams, this is identical to the
         result displayed in single compositing layer mode. If a JPX file contains a
         composition box, however, the composition instructions are used to build the
         composited image which was intended by the content creator. For MJ2 files,
         this mode is currently equivalent to single compositing layer mode, so you can
         only view one video track at a time. However, this is a limitation only of the
         "<em>kdu_show</em>" and "<em>kdu_macshow</em>" demo applications; the
         underlying `<em>kdu_region_compositor</em>' object, which does all the
         rendering work, fully supports composed video.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         When a new file is opened, "<em>kdu_show</em>" starts out in the composited
         image mode, but if you have changed the mode to single component or single
         compositing layer mode, you may get back to composited image mode by using the
         View menu or hitting the "c" accelerator.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
         While in composited image mode, you may navigate forward and backward between
         composited frames (animations contain multiple frames, each of which is a
         composited image) by using the RETURN and BACKSPACE keys, or via the View
         menu.
      </p>
</dd>
</dl>

<A name="Status Information"></A>
<h1 class="section">Status Information</h1>
<p>
   Some summary information is displayed at the bottom of the application window
   on its status bar. The status bar is divided into fields. The information
   displayed in these fields also depends upon the status mode, which may be
   toggled using the Status menu, or via the "t" accelerator key. In particular,
   you can currently toggle between the following status modes:
</p>
<p>
   <u><strong>Windows</strong></u>
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left field displays current zoom factor (percent) and image element; right
         field displays the number of quality layers. The image element depends on the
         image display mode. In single component mode, the component index and
         codestream index are displayed here; in single compositing layer mode, the
         compositing layer index is displayed here; in composited image mode, the
         animation frame index is displayed here. If the view window (or a focus box)
         covers imagery which derives from only one codestream, additional scaling
         factors for that codestream may be shown in parentheses after the main
         (global) scaling factor. The reason for different scaling factors is that
         codestream imagery may be arbitrarily scaled onto composited frames in a JPX
         presentation.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left field is as above; right field displays the full size of the image at the
         current resolution, measured in pixels.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left field displays the amount of working memory used by the codestream
         management machinery (for all codestreams currently loaded into memory). This
         value is generally very small if the codestreams are enabled for random access
         (precincts, PLT marker segments and a layer-minor progression order).
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         (available only when connected to a JPIP server): left field displays
         active/idle transmission status (idle when all requested imagery for the
         current view/focus window has been received); centre field displays a progress
         indicator, measuring the proportion of quality layers relevant to the selected
         region which are currently in the local cache; right field displays total
         transmitted bytes and the average data rate at which transmitted bytes have
         arrived, averaged only over non-idle periods.
      </p>
   </li>
</ol>
<p>
   <u><strong>MAC</strong></u>
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left field displays current zoom factor (percent); centre field displays
         current image element; right field displays number of quality layers. The
         interpretations of these quantities are as given above for the Windows viewer.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left and centre fields as above; right field displays the full size of the
         image at the current resolution, measured in pixels -- i.e., exactly the same
         as the Windows viewer.
      </p>
   </li>
   <li>
      <p>
         Left and centre fields as above (current zoom factor and image element); right
         field displays the amount of working memory used by the codestream management
         machinery (for all codestreams currently loaded into memory). As described for
         the Windows viewer, this value is generally very small if the codestreams are
         enabled for random access (precincts, PLT marker segments and a layer-minor
         progression order).
      </p>
</li>
</ol>

<A name="Remote Image Browsing with JPIP"></A>
<h1 class="section">Remote Image Browsing with JPIP</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>j</sub>pip"></a>
</p>
<p>
   The material in this section currently applies only to the "<em>kdu_show</em>"
   utility for Windows.
</p>
<p>
   By and large, images may be accessed remotely from a JPIP server (such as that
   implemented by the "<em>kdu_server</em>" utility) exactly as if they were
   local files. Rather than experiencing significant delays while the image
   downloads, you will instead observe incrementally improving quality as image
   data is incrementally transferred by the server. JPIP servers focus the
   transmitted data around the region defined by the focus window so the quality
   in that region increases more rapidly. If no focus window is defined, it is
   taken to be the current view window. Once sufficient data has been received to
   reconstruct the image within the focus window without loss, at the current
   display resolution, the server enters the idle mode and will not transmit any
   further data until the image region, resolution (zoom factor), codestream,
   image components, compositing layer or animation frame are changed.
</p>
<p>
   It is important to realize that the viewing tool is only loosely
   (asynchronously) coupled to the client component and, ultimately, to the
   server utility. You are always free to pan, zoom and otherwise navigate the
   display to any part of the image, regardless of whether any data has been
   received from the server to render that region. After some time, the server
   will adjust its transmission pattern to serve the new image region/resolution
   which is currently of interest. Of course, if the server has disconnected, no
   amount of navigation will bring in new data, so you will generally be left
   with non-uniform image quality which reflects the amount of time spent
   browsing in different image regions.
</p>
<p>
   It is also important to realize that the JPIP server is allowed to shrink the
   region of the image for which it will serve data, if the region is too large
   to be served in a quality progressive fashion without consuming excessive
   server memory resources. If this happens, the changed region will be reflected
   on the view window through a new focus box. You may move this modified focus
   box around, to change the region to which the server's transmission is
   customized, but you may not enlarge the focus box without having the server
   force it back down again to its size limit.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Regular Image Browsing</h2>
<p>
   To open a remote image, use the File-&gt;OpenURL menu item, or start
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" with an appropriate URL on the command line. The
   File-&gt;OpenURL dialog box provides several fields for you to fill out. For
   regular image browsing, enter the name of the file you want to access in the
   "<em>Object requested from server</em>" field and enter the name or IP address
   of the server machine in the "<em>Server name or address</em>" field. You may
   append an optional colon-separated port number to the server name or address,
   if your server is not listening on the default port 80.
</p>
<p>
   One of three closely related JPIP transfer protocols may be selected via the
   "<em>Channels and Sessions</em>" drop-down list. For the most efficient
   communication, the "<em>http-tcp</em>" option is recommended; however, this
   requires the establishment of both an HTTP and a regular TCP channel, which
   might not be permitted by some institutional firewalls. In this case, select
   "<em>http</em>" as the next best option. The "<em>none</em>" option is
   primarily for experimental purposes. It is much less efficient, especially for
   the server.
</p>
<p>
   If your organization requires all external traffic to flow through an HTTP
   proxy, select the "<em>http</em>" option and put the name or address of your
   HTTP proxy server in the "<em>Proxy name</em>" field -- you may need to
   consult your system administrator to find out the name of your HTTP proxy.
   Proxies reduce the communication efficiency and responsiveness, so use them
   only if necessary.
</p>
<p>
   You may elect to have all your image browsing results saved in a local cache
   directory, by entering the name of this directory into the "<em>Cache
   dir</em>" field. The advantage of this is that when you open the same image
   again on the same server, or a compatible server (one which assigns the same
   unique target identifier to the image resource), the previous browsing results
   will be reused and that data will not be sent over again by the server.
</p>
<p>
   An alternate way to open an image on a remote JPIP server is to supply the URL
   on the command line. The URL must commence with either "<em>http://</em>" or
   "<em>jpip://</em>" as the protocol identifier prefix, followed by the server
   host name (or IP address), a single "/" character, and then the resource
   string. The syntax for the resource string and the server name are identical
   to those used by the File-&gt;OpenURL dialog box. The alternate "
   <em>jpip://</em>" protocol identifier is provided so that the "
   <em>kdu_show</em>" utility can be fired up automatically from a web browser
   whenever a URL with this protocol identifier is encountered. In fact
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" registers itself with the Windows Internet Explorer as the
   target for such URLs, the first time it is ever used. You should be aware that
   when URLs are supplied on the command line, "<em>kdu_show</em>" obtains the
   remaining information (proxy server, cache directory, protocol variant) from
   the registry, based on the last values supplied via the File-&gt;OpenURL
   dialog. For this reason, it is advisable to use this dialog to configure the
   application first, before opening URL's from the command line or by clicking
   on JPIP URLs on a web page.
</p>
<p>
   You may explicitly disconnect from a JPIP server, without actually closing the
   image, by using the File-&gt;Disconnect menu item.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">One-Shot Image Browsing</h2>
<p>
   To implement the functionality of an image browser, "<em>kdu_show</em>" uses
   Kakadu's `<em>kdu_client</em>' object to generate a sequence of much more
   complex HTTP requests than that supplied via a typical command line URL. These
   much richer requests are generated using either HTTP POST or HTTP GET with
   query parameters appended to the URL, separated by the usual "?" query
   separator.
</p>
<p>
   As an alternative to interactive image browsing, you may supply one of these
   more complicated URLs directly by including the ``?'' query separator and the
   query fields of interest. In this case, only one request will be delivered to
   the server and no amount of interactive navigation within the image will cause
   any further requests to be sent to the server. The server will continue to
   transmit data relevant to the original request until all relevant information
   has been sent or the server times out or is disconnected. As a result,
   interactive navigation and image data delivery are entirely disconnected
   processes; you may be receiving data relevant to a small image region at high
   resolution, but be viewing the image at low resolution (zoom factor) or
   vice-versa. You may even be viewing a completely different codestream within
   the data source and so not see the effects of newly arrived image data.
</p>
<p>
   The main purpose of this mode of behaviour is for server debugging and for
   modeling the behaviour of JPIP when all imagery is generated in response to a
   static URL, which might be embedded in an HTML page.
</p>
<p>
   You may also enter single-shot URLs via the File-&gt;OpenURL dialog. To do so,
   simply append the "?" query separator and relevant query parameters to the
   string entered in the "<em>Object requested from server</em>" field of the
   dialog box.
</p>
<p>
   To use single shot URLs you will need to be familiar with the JPIP syntax. It
   is not the purpose of this document to describe this syntax, but the JPIP
   committee draft may be downloaded from "http://www.jpeg.org/CDs15444.html."
   You may also examine the JPIP requests delivered to the Kakadu server during
   normal interactive image browsing by supplying the
   `<code class="tt">-record</code>' command line option to "<em>kdu_server</em>
   ".
</p>

<A name="Properties, Metadata, Overlays and Editing"></A>
<h1 class="section">Properties, Metadata, Overlays and Editing</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>m</sub>etadata"></a>
</p>
<p>
   You may use "<em>kdu_show</em>" to view the coding parameter attributes and
   other properties of the codestream (or codestreams). You can also display, add
   and edit metadata in a JP2 or JPX file, resaving edited metadata in the JPX
   format -- only a limited subset of metadata can be saved in the more
   restrictive JP2 format.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Viewing Codestream Properties</h2>
<p>
   Use the File-&gt;Properties menu item or the "p" accelerator to view the
   coding attributes and other properties of the current codestream. Where more
   than one codestream is involved in the current image display, the application
   chooses one of them to display its attributes. Codestream properties include
   comment marker segments, coding parameter marker segments and tiling
   attributes.
</p>
<p>
   You may double-click (single click on the MAC) on any attribute to read a
   detailed description of that attribute's interpretation, as provided by the
   Kakadu core system. In the MAC viewer, this detailed description is
   conveniently formatted together with the current values of the parameter
   attribute in question.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Viewing the File Structure with Metashow</h2>
<p>
   Additional attributes are provided by the file format in which codestreams are
   embedded. To examine the file structure itself, use the Metadata menu or the
   "m" accelerator (Command-M on the MAC) to activate the "<em>metashow</em>"
   tool. You may click on various nodes within the metashow tool's tree view
   (browser view on the MAC) to obtain additional details or to have the main
   window navigate to corresponding image elements. For example, clicking
   (double-clicking in the MAC version) on the second compositing layer header
   box will cause the main window to enter single compositing layer mode and
   display the second compositing layer. Similarly, clicking on a contiguous
   codestream box or codestream header box will cause the main application to
   enter single component mode, while clicking on the composition box, if any,
   will cause the application to enter the composited image mode.
</p>
<p>
   Clicking on some leaf nodes in the metadata tree will cause their contents to
   be expanded as text, while for other boxes a generic hex dump is provided.
</p>
<p>
   In "<em>kdu_macshow</em>", the "<em>metashow</em>" tool provides you with a
   number of additional features. If you select a metadata item which corresponds
   to an editable JP2/JPX metadata node, the "<em>Open in Metadata Editor</em>"
   button will be activated, allowing you to edit the node, add descendants, etc.
   Although edited metadata does not become part of the file structure until the
   file is saved and reloaded, the MAC version of "<em>metashow</em>" uses
   strike-through conventions to highlight elements in the file structure which
   have been deleted (solid strike through) or changed (dashed strike through) by
   the editor.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Adding New Metadata</h2>
<p>
   To add metadata use the Metadata menu or the "a" accelerator. This opens up
   the metadata editing dialog, which allows you to enter text labels or to
   import externally edited label or XML box contents. If no focus box has been
   selected, the metadata will be associated by default with the top-most current
   image entity (compositing layer or codestream), depending on the current image
   display mode (see Section <span class="ref">sec<sub>n</sub>avigating</span>).
</p>
<p>
   If a focus box was defined at the time when you hit the "a" accelerator, the
   metadata will be associated by default with the top-most codestream which
   overlaps with the focus region; it will also be associated explicitly with
   that region. These associations are achieved by embedding appropriate number
   list and ROI description boxes in the JPX file (when you save the edited
   result).
</p>
<p>
   You may alter any of the above associations within the metadata editing
   dialog. The editor explicitly excludes options which are illegal; for example,
   metadata associated with a focus region must also be associated with at least
   one codestream, not just with compositing layers. You will see that you can
   add multiple associations, but it is up to you to ensure that this is
   meaningful.
</p>
<p>
   You can add descendant nodes to newly added metadata, via the "<em>Add
   child</em>" button, and navigate amongst the descendants you add in this way.
   For new metadata which is associated with a spatial region of interest, a
   label text node will automatically be added as a descendant, containing the
   initial string "<em>&lt;new label&gt;</em>". This is to remind you that
   regions of interest should probably have associated labels, and for backward
   compatibility with the much more limited editor provided with previous
   versions of "<em>kdu_show</em>". However, you can always delete this
   descendant if you like.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Metadata Overlays</h2>
<p>
   Once you have some spatially associated metadata, you will notice that
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" highlights its presence via partially transparent
   overlays. You may use the Metadata menu to control the appearance of such
   overlays. Most usefully, the "ctrl-o" accelerator may be used to toggle the
   overlay mode between <em>flashing</em>, <em>static</em>, and <em>no
   overlays</em>. You may also control the darkness/lightness of overlays via the
   Metadata menu, or by using the "ctrl-d" and "ctrl-b" accelerator keys.
   Finally, you may control the minimum size of elements which will appear on
   overlays.
</p>
<p>
   In the flashing or static overlay mode, try holding the control key down and
   moving the mouse cursor over regions which are associated with metadata
   (Windows version only). You will notice that the cursor changes to one which
   contains an "M" and the application displays temporary labels where
   appropriate. Keeping the control key down, you may also left click to open up
   the metadata editor again. This allows you to modify or delete existing
   metadata.  On the MAC, the metadata editor may be opened via the Metadata menu
   or via the Command-E accelerator key. On both Windows and MAC platforms, the
   metadata editor can be opened by double clicking in the view window.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Editing Metadata</h2>
<p>
   When the metadata editor is opened, using any of the above methods, it is
   initialized with a restricted set of metadata nodes which are considered
   relevant for editing. You can modify, delete or add descendants to any of
   these nodes. If the editor was opened by double clicking (or ctrl-right
   clicking in Windows) on a region of interest, displayed in the flashing or
   static overlay mode, only the ROI node and its descendants are included in the
   editing set. If the editor was opened by double clicking (or ctrl-right
   clicking in Windows) on any other part of the view window, the editing set
   consists of all metadata nodes which are associated with the image entities
   (codestreams or compositing layers) under the mouse cursor, plus all global
   metadata. You can navigate amongst these metadata nodes via the "<em>Previous
   sibling</em>" and "<em>Next sibling</em>" buttons. In "<em>kdu_macshow</em>",
   the Command-E accelerator key has the same effect as double clicking in the
   view window, opening the metadata editor with an editing set which depends
   upon the cursor position, unless you have selected a label in the metadata
   catalog pane; this is described further below.
</p>
<p>
   We close this section by noting that the metadata editor also provides a
   button for synchronizing the "<em>metashow</em>" window's contents with the
   metadata node currently being edited, so you can examine how the node is
   represented within the overall file structure. Of course, this is only
   possible for metadata nodes which are already present in the file structure,
   since the editor does not change the file structure until the file is actually
   saved.
</p>
<h2 class="subsection">Metadata Catalog</h2>
<p>
   This section currently relates only to the MAC version of "<em>kdu_show</em>".
</p>
<p>
   When you open a JPX image with associated metadata in the form of text labels
   (JPX label boxes), an auxiliary catalog panel is automatically opened on the
   right hand side of the image view. The same thing happens when you first add
   such metadata to an image which previously had none. You can always hide the
   catalog panel via the Metadata menu, but it is very convenient to keep around.
   The catalog contains a hierarchically organized record of all textual metadata
   in the source, under three broad categories:
</p>
<dl class="description">
   <dt class="leadin">Index Labels:</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are not descended (via the JPX "asoc"
         box hierarchy) from any "nlst" box (these <em>number-list</em> boxes identify
         image entities, meaning codestreams, compositing layers, or the "rendered
         result" of a composition), nor found within any codestream or compositing
         layer header box. As such, index labels are not directly associated with any
         image entity, nor can they be associated with any region of interest, since
         regions of interest inherently belong to image entities. In future releases of
         Kakadu, support for metadata cross-references (via "cref" boxes) will be
         added, so that index labels may still be indirectly associated with image
         entities or regions of interest, via a cross-reference. This, in fact, is
         precisely why we are using the term "Index label", since the primary
         application for such labels should be the creation of a top-level catalog with
         cross references to other imagery-specific metadata.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Image-Entity Labels</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are descended from an "nlst" box or
         found within a codestream header box or compositing layer header box, but not
         descended from an "roid" (region-of-interest description) box. These text
         labels are interpreted as being directly associated with whole image entities,
         as opposed to spatial regions within an image entity. Again, when
         cross-references are supported in a future release of Kakadu, you will still
         be able to link such labels indirectly to other, region-specific metadata, if
         you like. However, this probably makes less sense that the use of
         cross-references within a top-level catalog, as described above.
      </p>
   </dd>
   <dt class="leadin">Region-Specific Labels</dt><dd class="description">
      <p class="description">
         These correspond to text labels which are descended from an "roid"
         (region-of-interest description) box. As such, they are directly associated
         with a specific spatial region of interest. As noted in the previous section,
         regions of interest must themselves be defined with respect to a codestream,
         but they may also be associated with compositing layers or a composited
         result, which contains the reference codestream (or codestreams).
      </p>
   </dd>
</dl>
<p>
   The catalog panel maintains the hierarchical association between its labels,
   as identified by the embedding of metadata within JPX "asoc" boxes. Extra
   levels in the hierarchy are inserted, if required, if the number of sibling
   labels encountered at any point grows too large to conveniently display within
   the catalog pane. This is done by introducing automatically creating
   alphabetical groupings. For example, the three sibling labels, "ants",
   "apples" and "Amazing Apes" might all be grouped under the heading "A..." if
   is deemed to be beneficial for user navigation within the catalog panel.
</p>
<p>
   It is worth mentioning that the catalog panel machinery updates itself
   automatically whenever metadata is added, deleted or modified via the metadata
   editor. Once JPIP is enabled in "<em>kdu_macshow</em>", the catalog panel will
   also update itself dynamically as more data arrives from a remote server. All
   aspects of the catalog panel are dynamically adjusted, including the
   hierarchical association structure and the automatically generated summary
   groupings, such as "A..." for "ants", "apples" and "Amazing Apes". You can
   test this out yourself by adding a large number of metadata labels via the
   editor and watching what happens.
</p>
<p>
   Undoubtedly, the most useful feature of the metadata catalog is that it can be
   used to quickly navigate to associated imagery. All you have to do is double
   click any label in the catalog and the view window will adjust itself, if
   required, to show the associated codestream, compositing layer or animation
   frame, as appropriate. Moreover, for labels which are associated with spatial
   regions of interest, a focus box is automatically placed around the relevant
   spatial region's bounding box, and the view is panned and zoomed, as required,
   to make the region clearly visible.
</p>
<p>
   Once you have selected a label in the metadata catalog panel, you can use the
   Metadata menu or the Command-E accelerator to open that label within the
   metadata editor. For region-associated labels, the editor opens at the
   region-of-interest node ("roid" box) in which the label is embedded, since
   this is the place where you should modify the region shape itself if you wish
   to. You can always navigate to the label text via the editor's "
   <em>Descendants</em>".
</p>
<p>
   Likewise, once you have the metadata editor open at a label node, you can use
   its "Find in Catalog" button to select and bring into view the corresponding
   entry in the catalog panel.
</p>

<A name="Saving Files"></A>
<h1 class="section">Saving Files</h1>
<p>
   <a id="sec<sub>s</sub>aving"></a>
</p>
<p>
   You may save images back out of "<em>kdu_show</em>" via the File menu options.
   This is of interest particularly if you have edited an image's metadata, or if
   the image has been obtained from a remote JPIP server -- in that case, the
   saved file will contain whatever information has been received from the server
   up to the point when it is saved.
</p>
<p>
   You may edit and resave a file over the top of the file you already have open.
   In this case, however, the file is actually saved under a different name,
   formed by appending the "~" character to the name of the currently open file,
   rather than overwriting it. When you close the open file, any such saved copy
   is automatically renamed so as to replace the one you had open. This happens
   even if you close the application (by any of the usual means, or by hitting
   the "q" accelerator). The File menu provides a convenient "Save and Reload"
   option, which combines the above operations of saving over the current file
   and then re-opening it.
</p>
<p>
   You can save files as raw codestreams (choose a suffix of ".j2c" or ".j2k"),
   simple JP2 files (choose a suffix of ".jp2") or JPX files (choose a suffix of
   ".jpx" or ".jpf"). If you are currently viewing a motion JPEG2000 file (MJ2),
   you can save current frame as a JP2 file or a raw codestream, but you cannot
   currently save the entire movie.
</p>
<p>
   The File menu provides two additional variations on the "Save As" option,
   which enable you to force the use of external links to the codestreams or
   force the embedding of codestreams in the saved file. In most cases, all
   relevant codestreams are already embedded in the images you open with
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" and the "Save As" option retains this embedding. However,
   JPX files can contain links to codestreams which may be found in other files;
   the "Save As" option preserves such links rather than embedding the
   codestreams. "Save As Linked" forces the use of links, meaning that
   codestreams which are currently embedded in the file you have open will be
   recorded as links into that file. Linked codestreams are very useful while you
   are editing metadata for a very large image or collection of images, since
   each time you save your results, only the metadata structure need actually be
   written to disk. Of course, with linked codestreams you have to be careful not
   to delete or overwrite the file which contains the linked codestreams.
   "<em>kdu_show</em>" does its best to keep track of links into any of the files
   it has open and prevent you from saving over any of those files, but it can't
   be aware of files it does not have open.
