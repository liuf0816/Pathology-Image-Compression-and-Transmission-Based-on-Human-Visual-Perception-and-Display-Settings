     be non-NULL, depending on whether the stripe data is available as bytes
     or words.  The relevant member points to the start of the first
     unprocessed row of the current tile-component.
       The `ratio_counter' is initialized to 0 at the start of each stripe
     and decremented by `count_delta' each time we consider processing this
     component within the tile.  Once the counter becomes negative, a new row

     incremented by `vert_subsampling'.  The value of the `count_delta'
     member is the minimum of the vertical sub-sampling factors for all
     components.  This policy ensures that we process the components in a
     proportional way. */
