           "processing of each frame.  These can be blended in whatever "
           "way you like by separately selecting the number of frame "
           "processing engines and the number of threads to use within each "
           "engine.  The present argument takes a comma-separated list of "
           "descriptors, with one for each frame processing engine you would "
           "like to create.  Each descriptor commences with a positive "
           "integer, identifying the number of threads you would like to "
           "associate with the engine.  This may, optionally, be followed "
           "a CPU affinity mask, separated from the first integer by a "
           "colon.  The CPU affinity mask identifies the set of CPUs on "
           "which the threads for the frame processing engine should be "
           "scheduled.  If you have a system with a large number of CPUs, "
           "it is advisable to bind the frame processing engine's threads "
           "to specific CPUs so as to improve cache utilization.  Each "
           "non-zero bit in the binary representation of the CPU affinity "
           "mask corresponds to a CPU on which the thread can be scheduled.\n"
           "\t   If you do not provide a \"-engine_threads\" argument, "
           "the default policy is to create one frame processing engine for "
           "each physical CPU, assigning it a single-threaded processing "
           "environment.  Overall, the default policy provides a reasonable "
           "configuration, but it is not necessarily optimal.  The following "
           "things are worth considering when constructing different "
           "processing environments via this argument:\n"
           "\t  1) A separate management thread always consumes some "
           "resources to pre-load compressed data for the frame processing "
           "engines and to save the decompressed frame data.  If the "
           "`-display' option is used with an auxiliary parameter, at "
           "least one extra thread is created to manage the display update "
           "process -- in practice, however, DirectX creates some threads of "
           "its own.  On a system with a large number of CPUs, it might "
           "possibly be best to create less frame processing threads than "
           "the number of CPU's so as to ensure timely operation of these "
           "other management and display oriented threads.\n"
           "\t  2) As more threads are added to each processing engine, "
           "increasing inefficiencies are incurred due to occasional blocking "
           "on access to critical sections in the codestream management "
           "sub-system.  These are likely to decrease as Kakadu evolves, "
           "which might change the optimal balance between parallel engines "
           "and parallel processing within each engine.\n"
           "\t  3) Although the single threaded processing environment (i.e., "
           "one thread per engine) has minimal overhead, multi-threaded "
           "engines have the potential to better exploit the sharing of L2 "
           "cache memory between close CPUs.\n"
           "\t  4) The CPU affinity mask functionality might be implemented "
           "differently on different operating systems and might not be "
           "implemented at all on some platforms.  To see what support is "
           "offered, you may wish to refer to the implementation of "
           "`kdu_thread::set_cpu_affinity' in \"kdu_elementary.h\", "
           "assuming you have access to the Kakadu core system's source "
           "code.\n";

           "given time is set to twice the number of processing engines.  "

           "been read, but whose decompressed output has not yet been "
           "consumed by the management thread.  This argument allows you "
           "to specify the number of active frames as E + A, where E is "
           "the number of frame processing engines and A is the read-ahead "

           "`kdu_codestream::set_block_truncation' function, so that "
