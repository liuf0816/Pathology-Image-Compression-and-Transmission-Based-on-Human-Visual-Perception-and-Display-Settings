This object is required for multi-threaded processing
within a single 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A>. The main reason why this may be interesting is to
exploit the availability of multiple physical processors.
Kakadu's implementation goes to quite some effort to
minimize thread blocking and avoid cache coherency
bottlenecks which might arise in such multi-processor
environments, so as to keep all processors active close
to 100% of the time. To do this, you need to first
create a group of working threads, following the steps
below:
</P><UL><LI>
Create an instance of the 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> class, either on the stack (local variable) or on
the heap (using 
<B>new</B>).
</LI><LI>
Use the base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_thread</A> to add as many additional working threads to the group
as you see fit. A good strategy is to wind up with
at least one thread for each physical processor.
</LI></UL><P>
 Once you have created the thread group, you may pass
its reference into any of Kakadu's processing objects.
In the core system, these include all the objects declared
in "kdu_sample_processing.h" and "kdu_block_coding.h",
notably
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$cator.html">kdu_sample_allocator</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis.html">kdu_multi_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis.html">kdu_multi_synthesis</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$lysis.html">kdu_analysis</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1hesis.html">kdu_synthesis</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$3coder.html">kdu_encoder</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$2coder.html">kdu_decoder</A>; and
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$1coder.html">kdu_block_encoder</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$coder.html">kdu_block_decoder</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 Other higher level support objects, such as those
defined in the "apps/support" directory also should
be able to accept a thread group, so as to split their
work across the available threads.
</P><P>
 It is usually a good idea to create a top-level queue
for each tile, or each tile-component (if you are scheduling
the processing of tile-components yourself) which you
want to process concurrently. This is done using the
base member 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A>. You can then pass this queue into the above objects
when they are constructed, so that any internally created
job queues will be added as sub-queues (or sub-sub-queues)
of the supplied top-level queue. There are many benefits
to super-queues, as described in connection with the
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A> function. Most notably, they allow you to efficiently
destroy all sub-queues which have been created under
a given super-queue (this is a synchronized operation,
which ensures completion of all the relevant work).
</P><P>
 By and large, you need not concern yourself with synchronization
issues, except when you need to know that a job is
completely finished. To address the widest range of
deployment scenarios, the following facilities are
provided:
</P><UL><LI>
The base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A> allows you to wait until all outstanding jobs complete
within any given super-queue in the hierarchy. The
precise definition of the synchronization condition
is given in the comments associated with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A>; you should find that it is exactly the definition
you want in practical applications.
</LI><LI>
The base member, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html">kdu_thread_entity::register_synchronized_job</A> allows you to register a special job to be run when
a particular condition is reached among all queues
within an identified super-queue. Again, you should
find that the synchronization condition, defined in
the comments appearing with that function, is exactly
the one you want for a wide range of applications.
Synchronized jobs are a great place to include the
logic for incremental flushing of the codestream &mdash;
they allow you to schedule a flush (see 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A>) exactly as if you were operating in a single thread
of execution, while having it run in the background
without holding up ongoing processing of new image
samples.
</LI></UL><P>
 As for termination and exceptions, this is what you
need to know:
</P><UL><LI>
If you handle an exception thrown from any context
which involves your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object, you should call the base member function 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">kdu_thread_entity::handle_exception</A>. Actually, it is safe to call that function any time
at all &mdash; in case you have doubts about the context
in which you are handling an exception.
</LI><LI>
You can terminate and delete any portion of the queue
hierarchy, using the base member function, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A>. This can also be done automatically for you by the
<B>destroy</B> functions associated with the various sample processing
objects, but you should read the comments associated
with these objects carefully anyway.
</LI></UL><P>
 The use of various interface functions offered by
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface and its descendants can interfere with multi-threaded
processing. To avoid problems, you should pass a reference
to your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object into any such functions which can accept one.
Notably, you should identify your 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A> object when using any of the following:
</P><UL><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$tream__open_tile.html">kdu_codestream::open_tile</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__close.html">kdu_tile::close</A>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A>, 
<B>kdu_codestream::ready_for_flush and `kdu_codestream::trans_out</B>;
</LI><LI>
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__close_block.html">kdu_subband::close_block</A>.
</LI></UL><P>
 Remember: multi-threaded processing is an advanced
feature. It is designed to be as used with as little
difficulty as possible, but it is not required for
Kakadu to do everything you want. To reap the full
advantage of multi-threaded processing, your platform
should host multiple physical (or virtual) processors
and you will need to know something about the number
of available processors. The 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$_processors.html">kdu_get_num_processors</A> function might help you in this, but there is no completely
general software mechanism to detect the number of
processors in a system. You may find that it helps
to customize some of the architecture constants defined
in "kdu_arch.h", notably:
</P><UL><LI>
<B>KDU_MAX_L2_CACHE_LINE</B>,
</LI><LI>
<B>KDU_CODE_BUFFER_ALIGN</B>; and
</LI><LI>
<B>KDU_CODE_BUFFERS_PER_PAGE</B>.
