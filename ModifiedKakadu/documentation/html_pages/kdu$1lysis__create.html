Use this function to create an instance of the internal
processing machinery, for compressing data associated
with the supplied open tile interface. Until you call
this function (or copy another object which has been
created), the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exists.html">exists</A> function will return false.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that multi-component transformations
performed by this function are affected by any previous
calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A>. In particular, you need only supply those components
which have been marked of interest via the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function. Those components marked as uninteresting
are ignored &mdash; you can pass them in via 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> if you like, but they will have no impact on the way
in which codestream components are generated and subjected
to spatial wavelet transformation and coding.
</P><P>
 If insufficient components are currently marked as
being of interest (i.e., too many components were excluded
in a previous call to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A>), the present object might not be able to find a way
of inverting the multi-component transformation network,
so as to work back to codestream image components.
In this case, an informative error message will be
generated through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded processing
paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of multi-processor
platforms. To see how this works, consult the description
of these arguments below. Also, play close attention
to the use of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> arguments with the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> and

Returns the number of bytes which have been allocated
internally for the processing of multi-component transformations,
spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering
between the wavelet and block coder engines. Essentially,
this includes all memory resources, except for those
managed by the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> machinery (for structural information and code-block
bit-streams). The latter information can be recovered
by querying the

If this is true, the internal machinery will be configured
to work with 32-bit representations for all image component
samples, all the way through to the production of spatial
subbands for encoding. Otherwise, the internal machinery
will determine a suitable representation precision,
making every attempt to use lower precision implementations,
which are faster and consume less memory, where this
does not unduly compromise quality.

A non-NULL object may be passed in via this argument
to allow for region-of-interest driven encoding. Note
carefully, however, that the component indices supplied
to the 
<A HREF="kdu$image__acquire_node.html">kdu_roi_image::acquire_node</A> function correspond to codestream image components.
It is up to you to ensure that the correct geometry
is returned for each codestream image component, in
the event that the source image components do not map
directly (component for component) to codestream image
components.

This argument represents the opposite extreme in precision
selection to that represented by 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A>. The argument is ignored if 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A> is true. If 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#want_fastest">want_fastest</A> is true and 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A> is false, the function selects the lowest internal
precision possible, even if this does sacrifice image
quality. This also generally results in the fastest
possible implementation. The 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#want_fastest">want_fastest</A> option usually makes more sense for decompression
(see 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html">kdu_multi_synthesis::create</A>) than it does for compression. Even in compression
applications, however, it can make sense to perform
irreversible compression of high bit-depth imagery
using a lower internal precision, if you know that
you are not going to be targeting a very high compressed
bit-rate. It can happen, for example, that you want
to compress 16-bit imagery, with no more fidelity than
you would be interested in typically for 8-bit imagery.
In that case, you might as well use the same internal
implementation precision you would use for 8 or 10-bit/sample
imagery if speed is important to you.
</P><P>
 Essentially, this argument forces the selection of
the lower precision 16-bit internal representations,
for all processing which involves irreversible transforms
&mdash; reversible transforms must currently be implemented
using the required precision, or else numerical overflow
might result.

This argument must be strictly positive. It identifies
the number of row buffers maintained internally for
each codestream component. As codestream component
lines are generated they are temporarily buffered until
the stripe buffer is full. At that point all of the
buffered rows are passed consecutively to the spatial
DWT analysis and block encoding processes. Larger stripe
buffers have the potential to reduce context switching
overhead when working with a large number of components
or a large number of tiles. On the other hand, the
price you pay for this is increased memory consumption.
For single-threaded processing, a stripe height of
1 is usually fine (although perhaps not quite optimal).
For multi-threaded processing with the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> option set to true, however, it is advisable to use
a larger stripe height (e.g., 8 or even 16) since the
thread context switching overhead is considerably higher
than that of individual function calls within a single
thread.

<P>
Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
multi-threaded processing. After creating a cooperating
thread group by following the procedure outlined in
the description of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>, any one of the threads may be used to construct this
processing engine. Separate processing queues will
automatically be created for each image component.
If 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is set to true, these queues will also be used to
schedule the spatial wavelet transform operations associated
with each image component as jobs to be processed asynchronously
by different threads. Regardless of whether 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is true or false, within each tile-component, separate
queues are created to allow simultaneous processing
of code-blocks from different subbands.
</P><P>
 By and large, you can use this object in exactly the
same way when 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL as you would with a NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> argument. That is, the use of multi-threaded processing
can be largely transparent. However, you must remember
the following two points:
</P><UL><LI>
You must supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function &mdash; it need not refer to the same thread
as the one used to create the object here, though.
</LI><LI>
You cannot rely upon all processing being complete
until you invoke the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A> function, or until you call 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__destroy.html">destroy</A> with a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> argument. If you are considering using the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A> function to synchronize all processing prior to running
some job (e.g., incremental flushing with 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A>), you might want to seriously consider the advantages
of registering a synchronized job to do this in the
background &mdash; see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html">kdu_thread_entity::register_synchronized_job</A>.

<H4><A NAME="env_queue">env_queue</A> [<B>kdu_thread_queue</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">

This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. When 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside
this object are added as sub-queues of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> (or as top-level queues if 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is NULL). If you do supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>, it is best to use a separate 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> (obtained using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A>) for each tile processing engine which you want to
keep active concurrently. That way, you can individually
wait upon completion of the activities within the engine,
using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A>; also, with a separate high-level queue for each tile
engine, you can terminate all of the queues created
for that engine, without affecting any others, by passing
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> argument supplied here into 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A>.
</P><P>
 Another advantage of supplying a separate 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> for each tile processing engine is that it can improve
the efficiency of Kakadu's thread scheduling algorithm.
This algorithm tries to keep each thread working in
the same queue as it was previously working, so long
as there are jobs. Failing this, it tries to assign
the thread to a queue with the closest possible common
ancestor to the one it is currently working in. Thus,
by supplying a unique 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> when calling this constructor, you can be sure that
threads which are processing this tile will continue
to do so until there is no more work to be done &mdash;
this reduces the likelihood of cache misses, since
all of the working memory associated with a tile is
allocated in a single contiguous block, managed by
the 
<B>allocator</B> object.

<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. It allows you to determine whether the
spatial DWT operations associated with each codestream
image component should be executed as asynchronous
jobs (via 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_jobs</A>) or synchronously when new imagery is supplied via
the 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> function.
</P><P>
 In the latter case (i.e., 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A>=false), the thread which calls 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__exc$nge_line.html">exchange_line</A> performs all multi-component and spatial transform
processing, leaving only the CPU-intensive block coding
operations for other threads. This may leave these
extra threads occasionally idle, particularly in systems
which have a large number of physical processors. Nevertheless,
it is the simplest way to make good use of parallel
processing.
</P><P>
 If you set 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> to true, two sets of stripe buffers will be maintained
for each codestream image component, each having 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A> rows. New lines can be pushed to one stripe buffer
while the other is being processed asynchronously by
other threads. This approach has the maximum potential
to exploit the availability of parallel processing
resources. However, you must be careful to select a
good value for 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A>, since scheduling jobs onto threads incurs a non-negligible
overhead. This is particularly important if you have
very narrow tiles. One rough guide is to arrange for
H*W to be around 2048 samples or more, where W is the
tile width and H is the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A>. Thus, for small tiles of, say, 128x128, you might
select a stripe height of 16 rows. In any case, with
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> set to true, it is a good idea (and not particularly
costly in terms of memory, relative to other parts
of the system) to set the stripe height to at least
8 rows.
</P><P>
 At the end of the day, to get the most out of a multi-processor
platform, you should be prepared to play around with
the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A> and compare the performance with that obtained when
<A HREF="kdu$1lysis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is false.
