<P>
This function waits for all outstanding work on the
supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> and all of its descendants (sub-queues, sub-sub-queues,
etc.) to complete. If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> is NULL, all work on all queues must complete before
the function returns. By the time the function returns,
all threads which have done any work within the identified
sub-tree of the queue hierarchy are guaranteed also
to have invoked their 
<B>do_sync</B> function, since they have either become idle or moved
onto other branches in the queue hierarchy &mdash;
see 
<B>do_sync</B> for a discussion of the conditions under which that
function is called. The bottom line is that you can
be quite sure that all relevant work has been done
and that all relevant thread-local state information
has been globally synchronized by the time the function
returns.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that the calling thread itself
contributes to the pool of working threads. This minimizes
the performance penalty which can be expected from
invoking this function frequently. Also, the caller
will not throw an exception if failure occurs inside
the thread group. Instead, the return value indicates
whether or not this has occurred.
</P><P>
 One important restriction of the present function
is that the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> argument may not refer to a leaf in the queue hierarchy
&mdash; i.e., it must refer to a queue which has sub-queues.
The only exception to this is where a leaf queue has
never been assigned any jobs. The reason for this restriction
is rather technical, but the main reason has to do
with the fact that we need to ensure that 
<B>do_sync</B> has been invoked on any thread which has done work
in the queue by the time the synchronization condition
is achieved, while at the same time we want to avoid
calling 
<B>do_sync</B> overly often. The compromise is to allow this function
to be invoked only on super-queues and to insist that
whenever a thread moves from processing within one
non-leaf queue to processing within a different non-leaf
queue, or between leaves with different super-queues,
the 
<B>do_sync</B> function will be called first. For more on this, 
<B>do_sync</B>.
</P><P>
 It is worth pointing out that 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> can be used to directly wait for completion of outstanding
jobs on a queue, but the behaviour offered by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> is quite different (in fact complementary) to that
offered by 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A>. While the present function cannot be invoked on leaf
queues, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> function will commonly be used to wait for completion
of outstanding jobs on leaf queues. Also, while this
function can be invoked over the entire thread group
(by setting 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> to NULL), the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> function requires a non-NULL queue to wait upon. Finally,
the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> function is only interested in synchronizing on a
single queue, without regard for the state of its sub-queues.
By contrast, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> synchronizes on the entire sub-tree anchored at 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A>.
</P><P>
 Since this function may be invoked from any thread,
a natural question to ask is what happens if a thread
adds jobs to the queue on which we are waiting or any
of its descendants, while we are still waiting. The
behaviour in this case, may be understood in terms
of the following recursive description of queue synchronization
points:
</P><UL><LI>
When 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> is called, a synchronization point, S_q, is immediately
installed in the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A>, q. In particular, S_q is set equal to the index of
the next job to be added to that queue.
</LI><LI>
Once the job with index S_q-1 completes (or immediately,
if the job has already completed or no job was ever
added), a synchronization point, S_b, is installed
in each of its sub-queues, b; the value of S_b is set
equal to the index of the next job to be added to the
corresponding sub-queue, b.
</LI><LI>
This procedure continues recursively, until we encounter
a leaf queue. Once all leaf queues, e, under the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html#root_queue">root_queue</A> have reached their synchronization points (i.e., once
all corresponding jobs S_e-1 complete), the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> function returns.
</LI></UL><P>
 A second important question to answer here is what
happens if a thread attempts to synchronize on a condition
while a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> is already in progress. The implementation here is
intended to handle such situations robustly. It does
so by maintaining a list of synchronization points
inside each queue. Once any queue reaches a synchronization
point, the next element in the list is moved to the
head. There is, however, a limit on the number of outstanding
synchronization points which any queue can manage &mdash;
this limit is given by the 
<B>KDU_MAX_SYNC_NESTING</B> macro.
</P><P>
 Note that it is perfectly legal to wait upon queues
which currently belong to dormant banks (see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>). If the condition must be waited upon, it will not
occur until after the relevant dormant queue banks
have become active, in the normal course of affairs.
</P><P>
 For additional information on the handling of synchronization
conditions, you may wish to consult the documentation
for the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html">register_synchronized_job</A> function.

False if any thread in the entire thread group has
invoked its 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__han$exception.html">handle_exception</A> function. In this case, the synchronized state will
generally be achieved quickly, since all outstanding
jobs on all queues should have been cancelled.

If NULL, we are waiting for all queues in the entire
thread group to complete. Otherwise, we are waiting
only for the completion of jobs on the indicated queue
and all of its descendant queues. Note that 
<B>queue</B> must point to a super-queue if non-NULL &mdash; i.e.,
a queue which has at least one sub-queue.
