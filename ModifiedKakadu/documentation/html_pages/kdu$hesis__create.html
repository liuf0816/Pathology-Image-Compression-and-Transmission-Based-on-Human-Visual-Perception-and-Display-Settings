Use this function to create an instance of the internal
processing machinery, for decompressing data associated
with the supplied open tile interface. Until you call
this function (or copy another object which has been
created), the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__exists.html">exists</A> function will return false.
</P><P>
 Note carefully that the output components which will
be decompressed are affected by any previous calls
to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A>. You may use either of the two forms of that function
to modify the set of output components which appear
to be present. If called with an 
<B>access_mode</B> argument of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A>, the present object will present codestream image
components as though they were the final output image
components. If, however, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> was called with a component 
<B>access_mode</B> argument of 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_OUTPUT_COMPONENTS</A>, or if it has never been called, the present object
will present output components in their fullest form,
after processing by any required inverse multi-component
decomposition, if necessary. In either case, the set
of components which is presented is identical to that
which appears via the various 
<A HREF="kdu$tream.html">kdu_codestream</A> interface functions, such as 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$omponents.html">kdu_codestream::get_num_components</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__get$bit_depth.html">kdu_codestream::get_bit_depth</A>, and so forth, in each case with the optional 
<B>want_output_comps</B> argument set to true.
</P><P>
 It is also worth noting that the behaviour of this
function is affected by calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_tile__set$f_interest.html">kdu_tile::set_components_of_interest</A>. In particular, any of the apparent output components
which have been identified as uninteresting, will not
be generated by the multi-component transformation
network &mdash; they will, instead, appear to contain
constant sample values. Of course, you will probably
not want to access these constant components, or else
you would not have marked them as uninteresting; however,
you can access them if you wish without incurring any
processing overhead.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu v5.1, this function takes optional 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> arguments to support a variety of multi-threaded processing
paradigms, to leverage the capabilities of multi-processor
platforms. To see how this works, consult the description
of these arguments below. Also, play close attention
to the use of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> arguments with the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__destroy.html">destroy</A> functions.

spatial wavelet transforms and intermediate buffering
between the wavelet and block coder engines. Essentially,
this includes all memory resources, except for those
managed by the

If this is true, the internal machinery will be configured
to work with 32-bit representations for all image component
samples, all the way through to the production of spatial
subbands for encoding. Otherwise, the internal machinery
will determine a suitable representation precision,
making every attempt to use lower precision implementations,
which are faster and consume less memory, where this
does not unduly compromise quality. See also the definition

Be sure to leave this argument false unless you are
quite sure that you want to retrieve raw codestream
components without inverting any Part-1 decorrelating
transform (inverse RCT or inverse ICT) which might
otherwise be involved. For this to make sense, you
should be sure that the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__app$trictions__1.html">kdu_codestream::apply_input_restrictions</A> function has been used to set the component access
mode to 
<A HREF="globals.html#KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS">KDU_WANT_CODESTREAM_COMPONENTS</A> rather than

This argument represents the opposite extreme in precision
selection to that represented by 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A>. The argument is ignored if 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A> is true. If 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#want_fastest">want_fastest</A> is true and 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#force_precise">force_precise</A> is false, the function selects the lowest internal
precision possible, even if this does sacrifice image
quality. This also generally results in the fastest
possible implementation. The 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#want_fastest">want_fastest</A> option is generally appropriate when rendering to
8-bit display devices. Essentially, this argument forces
the selection of the lower precision 16-bit internal
representations, for all processing which involves
irreversible transforms &mdash; reversible transforms
must currently be implemented using the required precision,
or else numerical overflow might result. This means,
for example, that a reversibly compressed 16-bit/sample
image must be decompressed using 32-bit precision integers,
whereas a 16-bit/sample image which was irreversibly
compressed can be decompressed with an accuracy commensurate
with perhaps 11 or 12 bit imagery. This is generally
fine for display or projection.

This argument must be strictly positive. It identifies
the number of row buffers maintained internally for
each codestream component. Codestream component lines
are pulled directly off the relevant stripe buffer
until it is empty. At that point, the block decoding
and spatial DWT synthesis engines are used to generate
all stripe rows consecutively. Larger stripe buffers
have the potential to reduce context switching overhead
when working with a large number of components or a
large number of tiles. On the other hand, the price
you pay for this is increased memory consumption. For
single-threaded processing, a stripe height of 1 is
usually fine (although perhaps not quite optimal).
For multi-threaded processing with the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> option set to true, however, it is advisable to use
a larger stripe height (e.g., 8 or even 16) since the
thread context switching overhead is considerably higher
than that of individual function calls within a single
thread.

<H4><A NAME="env">env</A> [<A HREF ="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Supply a non-NULL argument here if you want to enable
multi-threaded processing. After creating a cooperating
thread group by following the procedure outlined in
the description of 
<A HREF="kdu$d_env.html">kdu_thread_env</A>, any one of the threads may be used to construct this
processing engine. Separate processing queues will
automatically be created for each image component.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is set to true, these queues will also be used to
schedule the spatial wavelet transform operations associated
with each image component as jobs to be processed asynchronously
by different threads. Regardless of whether 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is true or false, within each tile-component, separate
queues are created to allow simultaneous processing
of code-blocks from different subbands.
</P><P>
 By and large, you can use this object in exactly the
same way when 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL as you would with a NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> argument. That is, the use of multi-threaded processing
can be largely transparent. However, you must remember
the following two points:
</P><UL><LI>
You must supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> argument to the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> function &mdash; it need not refer to the same thread
as the one used to create the object here, though.
</LI><LI>
Whereas single-threaded processing commences only with
the first call to 
<B>pull_line</B>, multi-threaded processing may have already commenced
before this function returns. That is, other threads
may be working in the background to decode code-blocks,
perform DWT synthesis and so forth, and this may start
happening even before the present function returns.
Of course, this is exactly what you want, to fully
exploit the availability of multiple processing resources.
</LI></UL>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="env_queue">env_queue</A> [<B>kdu_thread_queue</B>&nbsp;*]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. When 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL, all job queues which are created inside
this object are added as sub-queues of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> (or as top-level queues if 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> is NULL). If you do supply a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A>, it is best to use a separate 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> (obtained using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_queue</A>) for each tile processing engine which you want to
keep active concurrently. That way, you can individually
wait upon completion of the activities within the engine,
using 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">kdu_thread_entity::synchronize</A>; also, with a separate high-level queue for each tile
engine, you can terminate all of the queues created
for that engine, without affecting any others, by passing
the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> argument supplied here into 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">kdu_thread_entity::terminate</A>.
</P><P>
 Another advantage of supplying a separate 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> for each tile processing engine is that it can improve
the efficiency of Kakadu's thread scheduling algorithm.
This algorithm tries to keep each thread working in
the same queue as it was previously working, so long
as there are jobs. Failing this, it tries to assign
the thread to a queue with the closest possible common
ancestor to the one it is currently working in. Thus,
by supplying a unique 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env_queue">env_queue</A> when calling this constructor, you can be sure that
threads which are processing this tile will continue
to do so until there is no more work to be done &mdash;
this reduces the likelihood of cache misses, since
all of the working memory associated with a tile is
allocated in a single contiguous block, managed by
the 
<B>allocator</B> object.

<H4><A NAME="double_buffering">double_buffering</A> [<B>bool</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This argument is ignored unless 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#env">env</A> is non-NULL. It allows you to determine whether the
spatial DWT operations associated with each codestream
image component should be executed as asynchronous
jobs (via 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">kdu_thread_entity::add_jobs</A>) or synchronously when new imagery is requested via
the 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> function.
</P><P>
 In the latter case (i.e., 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A>=false), the thread which calls 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__get_line.html">get_line</A> performs all multi-component and spatial transform
processing, leaving only the CPU-intensive block decoding
operations for other threads. This may leave these
extra threads occasionally idle, particularly in systems
which have a large number of physical processors. Nevertheless,
it is the simplest way to make good use of parallel
processing.
</P><P>
 If you set 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> to true, two sets of stripe buffers will be maintained
for each codestream image component, each having 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A> rows. New lines can be pulled from one stripe buffer
while the other is being processed asynchronously by
other threads. This approach has the maximum potential
to exploit the availability of parallel processing
resources. However, you must be careful to select a
good value for 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A>, since scheduling jobs onto threads incurs a non-negligible
overhead. This is particularly important if you have
very narrow tiles. One rough guide is to arrange for
H*W to be around 2048 samples or more, where W is the
tile width and H is the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A>. Thus, for small tiles of, say, 128x128, you might
select a stripe height of 16 rows. In any case, with
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> set to true, it is a good idea (and not particularly
costly in terms of memory, relative to other parts
of the system) to set the stripe height to at least
8 rows.
</P><P>
 At the end of the day, to get the most out of a multi-processor
platform, you should be prepared to play around with
the value of 
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#processing_stripe_height">processing_stripe_height</A> and compare the performance with that obtained when
<A HREF="kdu$hesis__create.html#double_buffering">double_buffering</A> is false.
