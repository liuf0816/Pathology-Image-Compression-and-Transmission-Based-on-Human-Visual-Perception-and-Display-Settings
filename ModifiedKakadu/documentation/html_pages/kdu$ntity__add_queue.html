Creates a new job queue, returning an opaque handle
to the created queue. You cannot directly access any
members of the job queue, but you can pass it to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">add_jobs</A>, or as a super-queue in further calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>, or as a synchronization or termination handle to
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A>, 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html">register_synchronized_job</A>.
</P><P>
 The association between jobs and queues is foundational
to the thread scheduling algorithm implemented internally.
You should create one queue for each distinct block
of memory in which workers might be required to perform
jobs. The scheduler will then attempt to keep threads
working in blocks of memory (queues) which they have
used before, while also keeping all threads occupied
whenever there is work to be done.
</P><P>
 The provision of a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html#super_queue">super_queue</A> argument means that the newly added queue is to be
considered a "sub-queue". If the scheduling algorithm
cannot keep a thread working within the same queue,
it attempts to keep it working within the same super-queue,
or that queue's super-queue, and so forth. Thus, the
use of super-queues provides the scheduler with more
clues regarding jobs which are likely to involve closely
related resources. The use of super-queues has three
important additional advantages:
</P><UL><LI>
Where a large number of queues is involved, partitioning
them hierarchically into super-queues can reduce the
number of queues which the scheduler must search to
find a free one.
</LI><LI>
It is possible to selectively wait for and terminate
just those queues which belong to a given super-queue.
</LI><LI>
It is possible to schedule special "synchronized jobs"
to be run within a super-queue, whenever its sub-queues
reach a declared state. By providing multiple super-queues,
it is possible to have multiple outstanding synchronized
jobs simultaneously.
</LI></UL><P>
 A typical way to use super-queues in the Kakadu environment
is as follows: 1) each tile processor may be associated
with a single top-level queue; 2) each tile-component
processor may be associated with a sub-queue of the
corresponding tile queue; and 3) each subband may be
associated with a sub-queue of the corresponding tile-component
queue. In this context, code-blocks are processed within
the leaf queues.
</P><P>
 To make the best use of multiple physical processors,
you should have at least one queue for each thread,
with at least one thread for each processor.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that any thread may create queues,
not just the group owner.
</P><P>
 From Kakadu version 5.2.4, queues can be additionally
organized into so-called "queue banks". Queue banks
allow for the deferral of all jobs on some queues until
the system can be reasonably sure that threads about
to become permanently idle. The idea is that banks
should be processed as sequentially as possible while
keeping all threads active as much of the time as possible.
</P><P>
 The system uses the information provided in calls
to the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">add_jobs</A> function to determine when the system is likely to
be "under-utilized," meaning that there are less working
leaf queues in the queue hierarchy than the number
of threads. A working leaf queue is any queue to which
jobs can still be added, which has no working descendants.
For more on working queues, see the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">add_jobs</A> function. The system also maintains a list of "dormant"
queue banks. Once the system becomes under-utilized,
dormant banks are moved onto the active list until
full utilization can be achieved. If the system is
under-utilized when a new queue is added, that queue
(and its bank) are immediately made active.
</P><P>
 If any queue belongs to a particular bank, all of
its sub-queues must belong to the same bank. For this
reason, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html#queue_bank_idx">queue_bank_idx</A> argument is ignored whenever 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html#super_queue">super_queue</A> is non-NULL. When super-queue is non-NULL, however,
the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html#queue_bank_idx">queue_bank_idx</A> argument is used to determine whether or not new banks
need to be created.

<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">kdu_worker::do_job</A> function is used to process jobs for this queue. This
argument can be NULL if you do not intend to add jobs
to this queue &mdash; in this case, the queue is being
used only to organize sub-queues in the overall queue
hierarchy. A working queue is one which has a non-NULL
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html#worker">worker</A>, for which not all potential jobs have yet been processed.
The 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html">add_jobs</A> function informs the system of the point beyond which
no more jobs will be added to a queue, so that its
working status can readily be determined.

If NULL, a new top-level queue is created. Otherwise,
a new sub-queue is added to the supplied super-queue.
The queue hierarchy may extend to any desired number
of levels. See the comments above for a discussion
of the merits of queue hierarchies.

If non-NULL, this argument must point to a constant

If you don't want any dormant banks, it is best to
leave this argument set to 0. Otherwise, you can use
it to add queues to initially dormant banks, which
become active only once the system becomes under-utilized.
A typical example of queue banks would be to use one
bank for each frame in a video sequence. This allows
you to add queues (and add jobs to the queues) for
frames which are not currently being processed, confident
in the fact that these will not start to consume processing
resources until the system becomes under-utilized,
which means that the processing of the current frame
(or codestream) is nearing completion.
