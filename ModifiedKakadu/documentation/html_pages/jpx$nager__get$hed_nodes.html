You can use this function to traverse all nodes in
the metadata tree which have been created for the first
time, deleted, changed in any way, or explicitly touched
by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A>. Once a node is returned by this function, it will
not be returned again, unless it is again added onto
the internal list of touched nodes, by one of the following
events:
</P><UL><LI>
If a node is deleted, using 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__delete_node.html">jpx_metanode::delete_node</A> it will be appended to the internal list of touched
nodes. Of course, its descendants will also be deleted
and appended to the list. Remember that deleted nodes
are not physically deleted from memory; one good reason
for this is to enable applications to track such deletions
via the present function.
</LI><LI>
If a node's ancestry is changed by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$ge_parent.html">jpx_metanode::change_parent</A> the node and all of its descencants will be marked
as having a changed ancestry and appended to the list
of touched nodes.
</LI><LI>
If a node's data is changed by 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$_to_label.html">jpx_metanode::change_to_label</A> or 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__cha$o_delayed.html">jpx_metanode::change_to_delayed</A>, the node will be appended to the list of touched
nodes and all of its descendants will be marked as
having a changed ancestry and also appended.
</LI><LI>
If 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A> is invoked, the node and all of its descedants will
be appended to the list of touched nodes.
</LI></UL><P>
 This function is provided to facilitate efficient
updating of application-defined structures as metadata
becomes available (e.g., from a dynamic cache) or as
metadata is edited.
</P><P>
 To find out what changes actually occurred, you can
use the functions 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__is_changed.html">jpx_metanode::is_changed</A>, 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__is_deleted.html">jpx_metanode::is_deleted</A> and 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__anc$r_changed.html">jpx_metanode::ancestor_changed</A>. All of these functions may return false if the node
is newly parsed from a data source or otherwise created,
or if the node found its way onto the touched node
list as a result of a call to 
<A HREF="jpx$anode__touch.html">jpx_metanode::touch</A>.
</P><P>
 One feature of this function is that metanodes which
are freshly created as a result of parsing an input
file are not considered o be touched until their principle
box has been completely parsed (this is the first sub-box
of an association box, or else it is the sole box associated
with the metanode). This means that every metanode
you find on the touched list is available in full,
except that its descendants, if any, might not yet
all be available. Once they become available, they
too will be added to the touched list.
</P><P>
 Noting that all of the conditions which cause a node
to be added to the internal list of touched nodes also
cause all of the node's descendants to be added to
the list, we are able to guarantee that parents always
appear in the list before their descendants, if any.
This can simplify some applications of the function.
