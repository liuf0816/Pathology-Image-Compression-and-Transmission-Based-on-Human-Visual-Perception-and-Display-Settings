Schedules one or more discrete jobs onto the indicated
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#queue">queue</A>. When a thread becomes available to service these
jobs, it will call the 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">kdu_worker::do_job</A> function, associated with the 
<A HREF="kdu_worker.html">kdu_worker</A> object which was installed with the queue during the
original call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>. In calling 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">kdu_worker::do_job</A>, it will pass in its own 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> identity, along with the index of the job. The 
<A HREF="kdu_worker.html">kdu_worker</A> object is expected to be able to figure out what must
be done, based on the job index alone.
</P><P>
 Job indices start from 0 (the first job added after
creation of the queue has this index) and increment
consecutively thereafter.
</P><P>
 The 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#finalize_queue">finalize_queue</A> argument plays an important role in minimizing thread
idle time in certain applications. The caller should
set this argument to false, unless it knows that there
will be no further jobs added to the present queue.
This allows the system to determine the point at which
the system is likely to become under-utilized, meaning
that there may be insufficient schedulable queues to
keep all threads working. The under-utilization condition
is explained more carefully in conjunction with the
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> function. If you cannot be sure whether or not new
jobs might be added to a queue, it is not essential
that you call this function with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#finalize_queue">finalize_queue</A> function set to true. This is because calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> automatically finalize the relevant queues before
terminating them. However, relying upon the termination
of queues for the detection of under-utilization may
lead to increased thread idle time. In any case, once
the last job in a finalized queue has been executed,
it ceases to be a "working queue", for the purpose
of the description found in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A> function.
</P><P>
 To understand the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> argument, it is best to know something about how Kakadu
schedules jobs. During their lifetime, jobs may take
on four different scheduling states: "active" (meaning
they are actually running); "runnable" (meaning they
are ready to become active whenever a thread becomes
available); "primary"; and "secondary". Jobs added
by this function start out either as "primary" or as
"secondary", depending on whether 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> is 0. Jobs are promoted to "runnable" only when a
thread would otherwise become idle due a lack of runnable
jobs to process. When a "primary" job is promoted to
runnable, all jobs in the entire queue hierarchy which
are currently in the "primary" state are simultaneously
promoted to runnable. This provides for a kind of fairness
across all queues in the hierarchy, where jobs are
advanced from "primary" to "runnable" in batches. If
no "primary" jobs are available and a thread would
otherwise have nothing to do, a single "secondary"
job is selected to keep threads from becoming idle.
</P><P>
 The idea is that no dependent tasks should ever need
to block on a "secondary" job. These jobs are provided
well in advance of their actual deadlines so as to
keep all processing resources in use as much of the
time as possible. Of course, one could expect that
"secondary" jobs would eventually become important
dependencies for other jobs &mdash; typically after
promotion, activation and completion of one or more
"primary" jobs.
</P><P>
 To accommodate the promotion of "secondary" jobs to
the "primary" state, we provide the following two policies:
a) whenever this function is called, any "secondary"
jobs on the queue which have not already become runnable
are automatically promoted to the "primary" state;
and b) the function may be called with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#num_jobs">num_jobs</A> equal to 0, the only purpose of which is to promote
all outstanding "secondary" jobs to the "primary" state.
</P><P>
 The Kakadu core system uses the "secondary" state
when adding block decoding jobs in subbands for which
existing decoded subband lines still remain to be consumed
by the DWT synthesis engine. Once the DWT synthesis
engine has consumed all previously buffered sample
lines, new secondary jobs are added, which advances
the existing secondary jobs to the primary state. A
similar thing is done for block encoding jobs.
</P><P>
 When a secondary job must be promoted directly to
runnable in order to keep threads active, an attempt
is made to promote first those secondary jobs whose
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> argument was smallest when they were added. The Kakadu
core system assigns higher 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> values to block decoding/encoding jobs which correspond
to higher resolution subbands, so that some higher
resolution ones are likely to still be available (as
fill in jobs) when the end of the image is reached.

If zero, the new jobs will be queued in the "primary"
service state. Otherwise, they are queued in the "secondary"
state and an attempt will be made to respect the supplied
sequence number, so that whenever a secondary job must
be promoted to the runnable state directly (to prevent
a thread from idling), jobs with lower 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> values will be promoted before jobs with higher 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_jobs.html#secondary_seq">secondary_seq</A> values.
