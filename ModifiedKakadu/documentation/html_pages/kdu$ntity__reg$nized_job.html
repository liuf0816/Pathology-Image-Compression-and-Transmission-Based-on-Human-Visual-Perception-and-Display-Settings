This function registers a special 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#worker">worker</A> object, whose 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">kdu_worker::do_job</A> function will not be called until all currently outstanding
jobs associated with the identified 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#queue">queue</A> and its descendants have been completed. To be more
specific, the conditions required for a synchronized
job to become runnable are identical to those described
for the 
<B>synchronization</B> function to return, i.e.:
</P><UL><LI>
When 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html">register_synchronized_job</A> is called, a synchronization point, S_q, is immediately
installed in the 
<B>root_queue</B>, q. In particular, S_q is set equal to the index of
the next job to be added to that queue.
</LI><LI>
Once the job with index S_q-1 completes (or immediately,
if it has already completed, or the queue has never
had any jobs), a synchronization point, S_b, is installed
in each of its sub-queues, b; the value of S_b is set
equal to the index of the next job to be added to the
corresponding sub-queue, b.
</LI><LI>
This procedure continues recursively, until we encounter
a leaf queue. Once all leaf queues, e, under the 
<B>root_queue</B> have reached their synchronization points (i.e., once
all corresponding jobs S_e-1 complete), the synhronized
job becomes runnable.
</LI></UL><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#queue">queue</A> is NULL, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#worker">worker</A> object is effectively registered against an invisible
super-queue which is the root of all queues in the
thread group. This means that the synchronized job
will become runnable only once all jobs which have
been added to any top level queue are completed, and
once all jobs added to their sub-queues prior to that
point have been completed, and so forth.
</P><P>
 Once a synchronized job becomes runnable, the 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">worker&rarr;do_job</A> function is either called immediately from the thread
which first caused the synchronization condition to
occur, or else it is stored on a queue of runnable
synchronized jobs, to be run when resources become
available. Which of these two actions is taken depends
on the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#run_deferred">run_deferred</A> argument.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#run_deferred">run_deferred</A> is true, and there are multiple threads, the synchronized
job is placed on a special queue associated with the
entire thread group, to be run as soon as any worker
thread completes all of its active jobs. In practice,
this means that deferred jobs will only be run by worker
threads within the context of their top-level 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__process_jobs.html">process_jobs</A> call &mdash; the one which has no 
<B>wait_queue</B>. This policy ensures that the processing of deferred
jobs cannot block the execution of any other thread.
It thus allows large background jobs to be completed
without risking a loss of throughput due to other thread
resources (and their CPU's) becoming idle. The downside
of deferred jobs is that you cannot be sure when they
will be run. In fact, it is possible that the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#queue">queue</A> against which they were registered will be terminated
before the synchronized job is run &mdash; depending
on how the application chooses to call 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>, of course. The only thing you can be sure of is that
all deferred jobs will be run before the return of
a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> which results in the deletion of all top-level job
queues. This is because such a call returns only once
all threads have passed through their 
<B>on_finished</B> function, which will not happen while deferred jobs
remain.
</P><P>
 If you would just like to install a deferred job,
without any associated synchronization conditions,
you have simply to create a queue which has no jobs
of its own and no descendants. Then register a deferred
synchronized job against this queue. Since synchronization
is achieved immediately, it will be added immediately
to the queue of deferred jobs.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#run_deferred">run_deferred</A> argument has no impact if there is only one thread.
In this case, deferred jobs are run as soon as their
synchronization conditions occur. If these conditions
exist already, the function will be run immediately.
</P><P>
 If two activities (synchronizing threads or synchronized
jobs) are registered against the same condition, they
will be performed (return from 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> or perform synchronized job) in the same order that
they were registered. If the order is important, then
you should request the relevant synchronized activities
from the same thread. A typical example is the registration
of a sychronized job, followed by a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> (e.g., through 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>). If both are done from the same thread, and the synchronized
job is not deferred, you can be sure that the synchronized
job will be run (completely) before 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> returns, which means that you will not terminate any
of the queues associated with a synchronized job until
after the job is complete. As already mentioned, this
cannot be guaranteed for deferred jobs (those registered
with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#run_deferred">run_deferred</A>=true). The only thing you can be sure of with such
jobs is that a 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A> call which specifies a NULL 
<B>root_queue</B> (i.e., one which terminates the entire queue hierarchy)
will wait until the comletion of all deferred jobs
before returning.
</P><P>
 As with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A>, each queue is able to manage multiple outstanding
synchronization points arising from any combination
of synchronized jobs and/or calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A>, with an upper limit for each queue set by 
<B>KDU_MAX_SYNC_NESTING</B>. Since you cannot predict definitively when a synchronized
job will be executed, it is possible that you could
overflow this limit by registering repeated instances
of a synchronized job without first checking to see
if previous instances have already been dispatched.
For this reason, if you intend to regularly schedule
synchronized jobs (e.g., calls to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">kdu_codestream::flush</A> for incremental codestream generation), you should
first check that previously scheduled jobs have been
dispatched. There are many ways to do this.
</P><P>
 Note that it is perfectly legal to register synchronized
jobs against queues which currently belong to dormant
banks (see 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_queue.html">add_queue</A>). If the condition must be waited upon, it will not
occur until after the relevant dormant queue banks
have become active, in the normal course of affairs.

If non-NULL, the synchronized jobs will become runnable
once all jobs on the specified 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#queue">queue</A> have completed, once all jobs added to any of its
sub-queues prior to that point have completed, and
so on. If NULL, the job will become runnable only once
this condition is achieved by all top-level queues.
As with 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__synchronize.html">synchronize</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__terminate.html">terminate</A>, this argument may only refer to a super-queue &mdash;
i.e., one which has at least one sub-queue &mdash;
or to a leaf queue which has never been assigned any
jobs. The reasons for this have to do with the conditions
under which 
<B>do_sync</B> and 
<B>need_sync</B> are called.

If false, or there is only one thread in the system,
the 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">worker&rarr;do_job</A> function will be called immediately after the job
becomes runnable. Moreover, no further synchronization
points associated with the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#queue">queue</A> concerned will be processed until after the 
<A HREF="kdu_worker__do_job.html">worker&rarr;do_job</A> function returns. On the other hand, if 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__reg$nized_job.html#run_deferred">run_deferred</A> is true and there are at least two threads (i.e.,
at least one worker thread, in addition to the group
owner), runnable jobs are entered on their own special
queue, to be processed by the next worker thread (not
the group owner) which has no active jobs, as explained
above.
