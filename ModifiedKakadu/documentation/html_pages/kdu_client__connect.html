Creates a new thread of execution to manage network
communications and initiate a connection with the appropriate
server. The function returns immediately, without blocking
on the success of the connection.
</P><P>
 The application may then monitor the value returned
by 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_active.html">is_active</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu_client__is_alive.html">is_alive</A> to determine when the connection is actually established,
if at all. The application may also monitor transfer
statistics using 
<A HREF="kdu_cache__get$red_bytes.html">kdu_cache::get_transferred_bytes</A> and it may receive notification of network activities
by supplying a 
<A HREF="kdu$ifier.html">kdu_client_notifier</A>-derived object to the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__ins$notifier.html">install_notifier</A> function.
</P><P>
 The network management thread will be terminated when
the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__close.html">close</A> or 
<A HREF="kdu_client__disconnect.html">disconnect</A> function is called, when the server disconnects, or
when a terminal error condition arises, whichever occurs
first.
</P><P>
 It is important to realize that the internal network
management thread may itself issue an error message
through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A>. For this to be robust, the 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage.html">kdu_message</A>-derived object supplied to 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$mize_errors.html">kdu_customize_errors</A> must throw an exception when it receives the call
to 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage__flush.html">kdu_message::flush</A> with 
<B>end_of_message</B> true. The implementation of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ssage.html">kdu_message</A>-derived object should be thread-safe and should be
able to successfully deliver its messages, regardless
of the thread from which it is invoked. These conditions
should not be onerous on application developers.
</P><P>
 The present function may itself issue a terminal error
message through 
<A HREF="kdu_error.html">kdu_error</A> if there is something wrong with any of the supplied
arguments. For this reason, interactive applications
should generally provide try/catch protection when
calling this function.

Holds the host name or IP address of the server to
be contacted. The 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A> string may contain an optional port number suffix,
in which case it has the form &lt;host name or IP address&gt;:&lt;port&gt;.
The default HTTP port number of 80 is otherwise assumed.
Communication with this machine proceeds over HTTP,
and may involve intermediate proxies, as described
in connection with the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#proxy">proxy</A> argument.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="proxy">proxy</A> [<B>const char *</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
Same syntax as 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#server">server</A>, but gives the host (and optionally the port number)
of the machine with which the initial TCP connection
should be established. This may either be the server
itself, or an HTTP proxy server. May be NULL, or point
to an empty string, if no proxy is to be used.
</P>
</DIV>
<H4><A NAME="request">request</A> [<B>const char *</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
This pointer may not be NULL or reference an empty
string. The string has one of the following forms:
a) &lt;resource&gt;; or b) &lt;resource&gt;?&lt;query&gt;.
In the former case, &lt;resource&gt; is simply the
name of the target file on the server. In the latter
case, the target file name may be held in the &lt;resource&gt;
component, or as a query field of the form "target=&lt;name&gt;",
in which case the &lt;resource&gt; string may refer
to a CGI script or some other identifier having meaning
to the server. In any event, the complete 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string may consist only of URI-legal characters and,
in particular, may contain no white space characters.
If necessary, non-conforming characters should be hex-hex
encoded, as described in RFC2396 (Uniform Resource
Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax).
</P><P>
 The &lt;query&gt; string may contain multiple fields,
each of the form &lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;, separated
by the usual "&" character. If a &lt;query&gt; string
contains anything other than the "target" or "subtarget"
fields, it is interpreted as a one-time request. In
this case, the request will be issued as-is to the
server, and once the server's response is fully received,
the connection will be closed. This type of request
might be embedded in HTML documents as a simple URL.
In this mode, any calls to 
<A HREF="kdu_client__post_window.html">post_window</A> will be ignored, since the application is not permitted
to interactively control the communications. Also,
in this mode, the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> argument is ignored and a session-less transaction
is used.

<H4><A NAME="channel_transport">channel_transport</A> [<B>const char *</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If NULL or a pointer to an empty string or the string
"none", no attempt will be made to establish a JPIP
channel. In this case, no attempt will be made to establish
a stateful communication session; each request is delivered
to the server (possibly through the proxy) in a self-contained
manner, with all relevant cache contents identified
using appropriate JPIP-defined header lines. When used
interactively, (nothing other than "target" or "subtarget"
query fields in the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string), this mode may involve somewhat lengthy requests,
and may cause the server to go to quite a bit of additional
work, re-creating the context for each and every request.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> holds the string "http" and the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#request">request</A> string does not contain any query request fields other
than "target" or "subtarget", the client's first request
asks for a channel with HTTP as the transport. If the
server refuses to grant a channel, communication will
continue as if the 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> argument had been NULL.
</P><P>
 If 
<A HREF="kdu_client__connect.html#channel_transport">channel_transport</A> holds the string "http-tcp", the behaviour is the
same as if it were "http", except that a second TCP
channel is established for the return data. This transport
variant is somewhat more efficient for both client
and server, but requires an additional TCP channel
and cannot be used from within organizations which
mandate that all external communication proceed through
HTTP proxies. If the server does not support the "http-tcp"
transport, it may fall back to an HTTP transported
channel. This is because the client's request to the
server includes a request field of the form "cnew=http-tcp,http",
giving the server both options.
</P><P>
 It is worth noting that wherever a channel is requested,
the server may respond with the address of a different
host to be used in all future requests.
</P>

<H4><A NAME="cache_dir">cache_dir</A> [<B>const char *</B>]</H4><DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
If non-NULL, this argument provides the path name for
a directory in which cached data may be saved at the
end of an interactive communication session. The directory
is also searched at the beginning of an interactive
session, to see if information is already available
for the image in question. If the argument is NULL,
or points to an empty string, the cache contents will
not be saved and no previously cached information may
be re-used here. Files written to or read from the
cache directory have the ".kjc" suffix, which stands
for (Kakadu JPIP Cache). These files commence with
some details which may be used to re-establish connection
with the server, if necessary (not currently implemented)
followed by the cached data itself, stored as a concatenated
list of data-bins. The format of these files is private
to the current implementation and subject to change
in subsequent releases of the Kakadu software, although
the files are at least guaranteed to have an initial
header which can be used for version-validation purposes.
