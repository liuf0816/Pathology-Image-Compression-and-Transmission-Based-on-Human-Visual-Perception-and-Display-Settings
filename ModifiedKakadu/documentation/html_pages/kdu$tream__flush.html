<DIV CLASS="indented-text">
<P>
In most cases, this is the function you use to actually
write out code-stream data once the subband data has
been generated and encoded. Starting from version 3.3,
this function may be invoked multiple times, in order
to generate the code-stream incrementally. This allows
you to interleave image data transformation and encoding
steps with code-stream flushing, avoiding the need
to buffer all compressed data in memory.
</P><P>
 The function may be used in two quite different ways:
</P><UL><LI>
Firstly, it may be used to generate quality layers
whose compressed sizes conform to the limits identified
in a supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. This mode of operation is employed if the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> argument is NULL, or if the first entry in a non-NULL
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array is 0. The function selects the smallest distortion-length
slope threshold which is consistent with these layer
sizes. Note that the k'th entry in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array holds the maximum cumulative size of the first
k quality layers, including all code-stream headers,
excepting only the size of optional pointer marker
segments (e.g., PLT and TLM marker segments for recording
packet and/or tile lengths).
</LI><LI>
Secondly, it may be used to generate quality layers
whose distortion-length slope thresholds are given
explicitly through a supplied 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, whose first entry is non-zero. The actual slope
thresholds recorded in this array are 16-bit unsigned
integers, whose values have the form A+256*log_2(delta_D/delta_L)
where delta_D is the reduction in MSE (possibly weighted
according to the frequency weights supplied via the
<A HREF="globals.html#Cband_weights">Cband_weights</A>, 
<A HREF="globals.html#Clev_weights">Clev_weights</A> and 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cweight">Cweight</A> attributes) associated with an increase of delta_L
in the byte count. The offset, A, is selected to ensure
that the entire range of slopes which could reasonably
be encountered can fit into the range 0 to 2^16. For
the purpose of determining appropriate 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> values, we point out that a threshold of 0 yields
the largest possible output size, i.e., all bytes are
included by the end of that layer. A slope threshold
of 0xFFFF yields the smallest possible output size,
i.e., no code-blocks are included in the layer.
</LI></UL><P>
 Normally, 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#num_layer_specs">num_layer_specs</A> should be identical to the actual number of quality
layers to be generated. In this case, every non-zero
entry in a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array identifies the target maximum number of bytes
for the corresponding quality layer and every non-zero
entry in a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array identifies a distortion-length slope threshold
for the corresponding layer.
</P><P>
 It can happen that individual tiles have fewer quality
layers. In this case, these tiles participate only
in the rate allocation associated with the initial
quality layers and they make no contribution to the
later (higher rate) layers. If no tiles have 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#num_layer_specs">num_layer_specs</A> quality layers, the code-stream size will be limited
to that specified in the highest 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> entry for which at least one tile has a quality layer.
</P><P>
 It can happen that individual tiles have more quality
layers than the number of layer specs provided here.
Packets associated with all such layers will be written
with the "empty header bit" set to 0 &mdash; they will
thus have the minimum 1 byte representation. These
useless packet bytes are taken into account in the
rate allocation process, so as to guarantee that the
complete code-stream does not exceed the size specified
in a final layer spec.
</P><P>
 When a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array is used to size the quality layers, zero valued
entries in this array mean that the rate allocator
should attempt to assign roughly logarithmically spaced
sizes (or bit-rates) to those quality layers. The logarithmic
spacing rule is applied after first subtracting a minimal
header offset consisting of the main and tile header
bytes, plus 1 byte per packet (3 bytes if EPH markers
are being used, 7 bytes if SOP marker segments are
being used, and 9 bytes if both SOP and EPH marker
segments are being used). Any or all of the entries
may be 0. If the last entry is 0, all generated bits
will be output by the time the last quality layer is
encountered.
</P><P>
 If the first entry in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array is 0 and there are multiple layers, the function
employs the following reasonable policy to determine
suitable rate allocation targets.
</P><UL><LI>
Let Z be the number of initial layers whose size is
not explicitly specified (if the last layer has no
assigned size, it will first be assigned the number
of bytes required to including all compressed information
in the code-stream, as described above.
</LI><LI>
Let R be the target number of bytes for the next layer.
</LI><LI>
Let H_k be the minimal header cost mentioned above
(main and tile headers, plus 1 byte per packet, but
more if SOP and/or EPH markers are used) for the first
k quality layers.
</LI><LI>
The rate allocator will try to allocate H_1+(R-H_Z)/sqrt(2^Z)
bytes to the first layer. The logarithmic spacing policy
will then assign roughly 2 layers per octave change
in the bit-rate.
</LI></UL><P>
 If one or more initial layers are assigned non-zero
target sizes, but these are followed by further non-final
layers which have no explicitly specified target size
(0 valued entries in the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array), the function adds the appropriate minimum
header size to the size specified for all initial non-zero
layers. This behaviour allows the user or application
to safely specify arbitrarily small bounds for the
lowest quality layers and usually mimics most closely
the effect an application or user would like to see.
</P><P>
 If both the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> arguments are NULL, the function behaves as though
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> pointed to an array having all zero entries, so that
the layer size allocation policy described above will
be employed.
</P><P>
 As noted at the beginning of this description, the
function now supports incremental flushing of the code-stream.
What this means is that you can generate some of the
compressed data, pushing the code-block bit-streams
into the code-stream management machinery using the
<A HREF="kdu$bband__open_block.html">kdu_subband::open_block</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$bband__close_block.html">kdu_subband::close_block</A> interfaces, and then call 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> to flush as much of the generated data to the attached
<A HREF="kdu$arget.html">kdu_compressed_target</A> object as possible. You can then continue generating
coded block bit-streams, calling the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function every so often. This behaviour allows you
to minimize the amount of coded data which must be
stored internally. While the idea is quite straightforward,
there are quite a number of important factors which
you should take into account if incremental flushing
is to be beneficial to your application:
</P><UL><LI>
Most significantly, for the Post-Compression-Rate-Distortion
(PCRD) optimization algorithm to work reliably, a large
amount of compressed data must be available for sizing
the various quality layers prior to code-stream generation.
This means that you should generally call the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function as infrequently as possible. In a typical
application, you should process at least 500 lines
of image data between calls to this function and maybe
quite a bit more, depending upon the code-block dimensions
you are using. If you are supplying explicit distortion-length
slope 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> to the function rather than asking for them to be
generated by the PCRD optimization algorithm, you may
call the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function more often, to reduce the amount of compressed
data which must be buffered internally. Note, however,
that the remaining considerations below still apply.
In particular, the tile-part restriction may still
force you to call the function as infrequently as possible
and the dimensions of the low resolution precincts
may render frequent calls to this function useless.
</LI><LI>
Before calling this function you should generally issue
a call to 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> which will tell you whether or not any new data can
be written to the code-stream. The ability to generate
new code-stream data is affected by the packet progression
sequence, as well as the precinct dimensions, particularly
those of the lower resolution levels. For effective
incremental flushing, you should employ a packet progression
order which sequences all of the packets for each precinct
consecutively. This means that you should use one of
PCRL, CPRL or RPCL. In practice, only the first two
are likely to be of much use, since the packet progression
should also reflect the order in which coded data becomes
available. In most applications, it is best to process
the image components in an interleaved fashion so as
to allow safe utilization of the 
<B>max_bytes</B> function, which limits the number of useless coding
passes which are generated by the block encoder. For
this reason, the PCRL packet progression order will
generally be the one you want. Moreover, it is important
that low resolution precincts have as little height
as possible, since they typically represent the key
bottlenecks preventing smooth incremental flushing
of the code-stream. As an example, suppose you wish
to flush a large image every 700 lines or so, and that
7 levels of DWT are employed. In this case, the height
of the lowest resolution's precincts (these represent
the LL subband) should be around 4 samples. The precinct
height in each successive resolution level can double,
although you should often select somewhat smaller precincts
than this rule would suggest for the highest resolution
levels. For example, you might use the following parameter
values for the 
<A HREF="globals.html#Cprecincts">Cprecincts</A> attribute: "{128,256},{128,128},{64,64},{32,64},{16,64},
{8,64},{4,32}".
</LI><LI>
If the image has been vertically tiled, you would do
best to invoke this function after generating compressed
data for a whole number of tiles. In this case, careful
construction of vertical precinct dimensions, as suggested
above, is not necessary, since the tiles will automatically
induce an hierarchically descending set of precinct
dimensions.
</LI><LI>
You should be aware of the fact that each call to this
function adds a new tile-part to each tile whose compressed
data has not yet been completely written. The standard
imposes a limit of at most 255 tile-parts for any tile,
so if the image is not tiled, you must call this function
no more than 255 times. To avoid generating empty tile-parts,
you can use the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__rea$for_flush.html">ready_for_flush</A> function, which returns true only if enough data is
available to ensure that the next call to the present
function will generate at least one non-empty tile-part.
</LI></UL><P>
 We conclude this introductory discussion by noting
the way in which values are taken in from and returned
via any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> and 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> arrays when the function is invoked one or more times.
When the function is first invoked, the mode of operation
is determined to be either size driven, or slope driven,
depending upon whether or not a 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array is supplied having a non-zero first entry. If
the layer sized mode of operation is in force, the
target layer sizes are copied to an internal array
and the same overall layer size targets are used for
this and all subsequent calls to the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function until the code-stream has been entirely flushed;
it makes no difference what values are supplied in
the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array for subsequent 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> calls in an incremental flushing sequence. If the
explicit slope thresholds mode is in force, the supplied
slope thresholds are also copied to an internal array
and the same mode is employed for all future calls
to this function until the code-stream has been completely
flushed. If subsequent calls provide a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, however, the supplied thresholds will replace
those stored in the internal array. This allows the
application to implement its own rate control loop,
adapting the slope thresholds between incremental 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> calls so as to achieve some objective.
</P><P>
 Regardless of the mode of operation, whenever this
function returns it copies into any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array, the total number of bytes which have actually
been written out to the code-stream so far for each
specified layer. Similarly, whenever the function returns,
it copies into any non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array, the actual slope threshold used when generating
code-stream data for each layer during this call.

This argument is ignored if slope thresholds are being
used to control layer formation, instead of target
layer sizes, or if this is not the final call to the
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html">flush</A> function (as already noted, the function may be called
multiple times before the code-stream is completely
flushed out). By default, the rate allocation logic
performs an additional trimming step when constructing
the final (highest rate) quality layer. In this trimming
step, the distortion-length slope threshold is selected
so as to just exceed the maximum target size and the
allocator then works back through the code-blocks,
starting from the highest resolution ones, trimming
the extra code-bytes which would be included by this
excessively small slope threshold, until the rate target
is satisfied. If 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#trim_to_rate">trim_to_rate</A> is set to false, the last layer will be treated in
exactly the same way as all the other layers. This
can be useful for several reasons: 1) it can improve
the execution speed slightly; 2) it ensures that the
final distortion-length slopes which are returned via
a non-NULL 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_thresholds">layer_thresholds</A> array can be used in a subsequent compression step
(e.g., compressing the same image or a similar image

If true, the rate-distortion slope and the target number
of bytes associated with each quality layer will be
recorded in a COM (comment) marker segment in the main
code-stream header. This can be very useful for applications
which wish to process the code-stream later in a manner
which depends upon the interpretation of the quality
layers. For this reason, you should generally set this
argument to true, unless you want to get the smallest
possible file size when compressing small images. If
the function is called multiple times to effect incremental
code-stream flushing, the parameters recorded in the
COM marker segment will be extrapolated from the information
available when the

This argument is ignored unless quality layer generation
is being driven by layer sizes, supplied via the 
<A HREF="kdu$tream__flush.html#layer_bytes">layer_bytes</A> array. In this case, it may be used to trade accuracy
for speed when determining the distortion-length slopes
which achieve the target layer sizes as closely as
possible. In particular, the algorithm will finish
once it has found a distortion-length slope which yields
a size in the range target*(1-tolerance) &lt;= size
&lt;= target, where target is the target size for the
relevant layer. If no such slope can be found, the
layer is assigned a slope such that the size is as
close as possible to target, without exceeding it.
