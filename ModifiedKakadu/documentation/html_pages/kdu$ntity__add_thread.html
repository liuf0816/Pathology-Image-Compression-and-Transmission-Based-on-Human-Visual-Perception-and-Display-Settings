This function is used to add worker threads to the
group owned by the current thread. The caller must,
therefore, be the group owner. The new theads are automatically
launched with their own 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> objects. They will not terminate until 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__destroy.html">destroy</A> is called.
</P><P>
 A reasonable policy is to add a total of P-1 workers,
where P is the number of physical processors (CPU's)
on the platform. The value of P can be difficult to
recover consistently across different platforms, since
POSIX deliberately (for some good reasons) refrains
from providing a standard mechanism for discovering
the number of processors across UNIX platforms. However,
the 
<A HREF="globals__kdu$_processors.html">kdu_get_num_processors</A> function makes an attempt to discover the value, returning
0 if it cannot.
</P><P>
 The role of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html#thread_concurrency">thread_concurrency</A> argument may seem a little more mysterious. This argument
is provided to deal with operating systems (notably
Solaris), which do not automatically create at least
as many kernel threads as there are processors, thereby
preventing the process from exploiting the availability
of multiple physical CPU's through multiple threads.
This problem can be resolved by using 
<B>pthread_setconcurrency</B> to set the number of kernel threads (threads associated
with distinct processors). However, it is unlikely
that application level programmers will remember to
do this or know what value to set. For this reason,
the default behaviour of the present function, when
operating in a PTHREADS environment, is to adjust the
thread concurrency to match the number of threads which
are added into the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object. This is a fine solution when there is only
one 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object, which is certainly the most common scenario.
When there are multiple objects, however, they may
compete with each other to set the thread concurrency
level for the process. You may avoid this problem by
supplying a non-zero 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html#thread_concurrency">thread_concurrency</A> argument, in which case that value will be passed
to 
<B>pthread_setconcurrency</B> each time. For operating systems which do not pay
any attention to 
<B>pthread_concurrency</B>, it does not matter what value you supply for this
argument. For consistency, however, the best approach
is either to set the argument either to 0, -1 or a
value equal to the number of processors you hope to
be able to utilize concurrently. The special value
-1 means that the existing thread concurrency level
should not be changed.

False if insufficient resources are available to offer
a new thread of execution, or if a multi-threading
implementation for the present architecture does not
exist in the definitions provided in "kdu_elementary.h".
You may wish to check them for your platform.

As explained at length above, this argument is best
set to 0, -1 or the number of physical processors you
would like to be able to use concurrently in your application
(not just in this instance of the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity.html">kdu_thread_entity</A> object, if there are multiple instances of it). Since
it is common to call the 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html">add_thread</A> function P-1 times, where P is the number of processors,
a reasonable policy would be to supply P for the value
of 
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html#thread_concurrency">thread_concurrency</A>, each time the function is called. If you leave the
<A HREF="kdu$ntity__add_thread.html#thread_concurrency">thread_concurrency</A> argument at its default value of 0, the actual thread
concurrency will be set equal to the number of threads
associated with this object, including the owner thread.
If you pass -1 to this function, the thread concurrency
will be left unchanged, which can be useful if you
don't want to alter a configuration optimized elsewhere.
